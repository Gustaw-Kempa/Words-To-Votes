"1","Policy Speech by the Prime Minister to the 201st Session of the Diet",2020-01-20,"1. Introduction(The Japan Olympics) It was the first time in Olympic history for the Games to be broadcast live by satellite. As the world watched, the final runner, Mr. SAKAI Yoshinori, entered National Stadium, carrying the Olympic flame. He was born August 6 in Hiroshima. The dignified run of this young man of 19 sent out a powerful message to the world that Japan had achieved reconstruction from its devastation after the war and was stepping out, full of confidence and pride, into a new era of rapid growth. “The Japan Olympics.” The 1964 Games that Mr. Sakai described in this way were truly achieved by all the Japanese people coming together as one. The eyes of the world came to be riveted on Japan, which was filled with positive dynamism towards the future. After half a century, that excitement will again find their way to Japan. With this year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games too, all of Japan will again work together to make them the greatest possible Games, the one that will move people all around the world. And from there, with the public being united, let us all step forward together towards a new era.(Stepping forward towards a new era) “Japan is no longer able to grow.” Seven years ago, we started vigorously firing three arrows at this “wall of resignation.” We have made use of the fruits of those efforts and, from supporting child rearing to making education free and even the work style reform, advance straightforwardly with the aim of creating a society in which all citizens are engaged dynamically. Looking squarely at the increasingly severe security environment, we established the Legislation for Peace and Security, fundamentally reinforcing our defense capabilities. Taking a panoramic perspective of the world map, I have traveled the world over to engage in dynamic Japanese diplomacy. Japan is no longer the Japan of the past. We have succeeded in completely breaking through the “wall of resignation.” Armed with that confidence and pride, beginning here and now, let us all together carve out Japan’s new era of Reiwa.2. The Reconstruction Olympic and Paralympic Games When the 2020 Olympic flame sets out on its run, its starting point is J-Village in Fukushima. That place, the base of operations dealing with the nuclear accident, has now been reborn into a Japan’s largest holy site of soccer, filled with children’s smiling faces. Following the reopening of the Joban Expressway, services will be restored along the entire length of the Japan Railways (JR) Joban Line this March. In Coordination with this, we are advancing preparations for the partial lifting of the evacuation orders in place in the difficult-to-return areas of the towns of Futaba, Okuma, and Tomioka. In the town of Namie, one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants powered by renewable energy will begin full operation. During the Games, those who are involved with the Games will use automobiles using this clean hydrogen as fuel. While the Games are underway, this hydrogen will also keep the Olympic flame alight. Lithium-ion batteries, robots using AI ⁠— industries that will open up the future⁠—are now poised to emerge from Fukushima one after the other. The number of overseas tourists visiting Miyagi Prefecture, which suffered enormous damage from the tsunami, is now more than twice the number before the disaster struck. Iwate Prefecture now welcomes three times its pre-disaster figure. The Michi-no-Eki roadside rest area that just opened for business this past September in the city of Rikuzentakata has enjoyed a bustling turnout, with 100,000 tourists visiting there in only a month. While the period for reconstruction and revitalization will end in the next fiscal year, we will make all-out efforts to wrap up the full reconstruction and revitalization of Fukushima as well as the reconstruction of Tohoku We will head towards the next stage under the responsibility and the leadership of politicians, with the Reconstruction Agency serving as the control tower. Nine years ago, Mr. Scott Fardy experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake in Kamaishi as a member of a rugby team there. “If I were to head back to my home country now, I’d regret it.” Even though he had been recommended by his family to return to Australia, following the evacuation advisory from the Australian Embassy, Mr. Fardy stayed in Kamaishi and continued to assist disaster victims facing hardship, such as delivery of relief supplies and transporting the elderly and sick persons. With the feelings of appreciation to his actions in mind, Kamaishi will serve as the host town of Australia for the Olympic and Paralympic Games this year. The 29 municipalities struck by the disaster will deepen their exchanges with those who provided them support, including the village of Noda, Iwate Prefecture, which is partnered with Taiwan, and the city of Nihonmatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, matched with Kuwait. I want people to see with their own eyes and experience for themselves the state of the disaster-affected areas, which are poised to be vigorously reconstructed thanks to their heartwarming support. This is what the “Reconstruction Olympic and Paralympic Games” mean to be. In the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, assistance was sent from 163 countries and regions. Now, from here, I wish to once again express my appreciation together with you all to the people of the world who extended a hand of warm assistance to Japan in our time of trouble.3. Regional revitalization(A tourism-oriented country) Close to 500 cities, towns, and villages in total will serve as host towns for the Games. This is an ideal opportunity for communities all around the nation to send out a message to the world about the charms of our local areas. From Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south, this year, we will hold the Japan Cultural Expo where people can come into contact with local cultures from all around Japan of which we are proud, including the traditional music and culinary culture that the Ainu have passed down to the present day as well as Ryukyuan dance. We will establish a system in which we can make proactive use of national cultural properties and support the creation of tourism spots through the ideas of local communities. We will deregulate the current arrangement regarding passenger transportation services with private cars that charge fees and sufficient means of transportation for tourists from overseas in areas outside the major cities. We will exert every effort to restore Shuri Castle at the earliest possible time. In March, we will open a second runway at Naha Airport. By expanding the number of takeoff and landing slots by over 100,000, we will work to promote the development of Okinawa as a gateway to Asia. In the run-up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, we will fully prepare cybersecurity measures and countermeasures against organized crime, including terrorism, thereby thoroughly ensuring safety and peace of mind. We will create the foundation of a tourism-oriented country, including by making information accessible in multiple languages and developing our Wi-Fi environment, all at once, with the Osaka Kansai Expo to be held five years from now also in our sights. Under a highly independent management board, we will conduct strict and fair and impartial screening and work to develop integrated resorts for tourists. In addition, we will develop tourism infrastructure that is among the very best in the world, including accommodations that meet diverse needs of tourists from overseas, aiming at achieving our target of welcoming 60 million overseas tourists annually by 2030.(Agricultural exports) Turning our eyes to the world will create new and broader opportunities for areas outside major cities. Last year, our exports of beef and rice to the EU increased by about 30 percent. Our exports of dairy products to Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) member countries also expanded by well over 20 percent. Our sweet-tasting Beniharuka variety of sweet potatoes is selling extremely well in Singapore and Thailand. Last year, sweet potato exports expanded by more than 40 percent. Last month, the ban over our beef export to China has been lifted. Making use of the Japan-U.S. trade agreement that entered into force this month, we will also support vigorously efforts to export Japan’s delicious and safe agricultural, forestry, and fisheries products to the world. We will strengthen our production base with budget measures of more than 300 billion yen, including shifting to larger-scale farming, increasing the number of cows being raised, and improving productivity in the fisheries industry. We will assist with efforts to cultivate overseas markets, including developing sales channels. Kobe beef, Ruby Roman grapes, Yumepirika rice—we will thoroughly protect such Japan brand, which is the crystallization of efforts made by farmers over so many years, from the risks of their products being replicated in overseas markets through leakage. We will further reinforce our countermeasures to classical swine fever (CSF). Even in cases of detecting infection in wild animals, we will make arrangements so that we are able to carry out measures to prevent infection from spreading, including the restriction of movement, in accordance with the Act on Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control. Regarding African swine fever (ASF) as well, we will step up our quarantine of meat and meat products brought in from overseas and thoroughly implement border controls.(Regional revitalization) When Typhoon 19 struck last year, the Yamba Dam helped preventing damage along the Tonegawa River. With respect to other dams, which are built for hydropower or irrigation water, we will compile measures for all class A river systems to utilize these dams centrally in the event of emergencies by breaking through the sectionalism across the ministries and agencies. Making use of the lessons learned from successive natural disasters, we will press forward with excavating riverbeds, maintaining embankments, and removing roadside utility poles all around Japan. We will also build a resilient electrical supply system through, for example, the regular upgrading of electrical transmission lines and collaboration among power companies, the Self-Defense Forces, and local authorities beforehand. We will promote our disaster prevention and mitigation as well as build national resilience, creating local communities that are resilient against disasters. Located seven hours from Tokyo by rail, the city of Gotsu in Shimane Prefecture is sometimes called “the town farthest from Tokyo.” For more than 20 years the number of people leaving the city exceeded the number of new residents; the city had shrank in size by 2,800 people—a ten percent drop in its population. However, as the result of vigorously encouraging young people to start business, finally two years ago the number of people flowing into the city surpassed the number departing, resulting in a social increase of population. Mr. HARADA Masanori moved there from Tokyo to grow coriander. It was the city government that engaged in negotiations for him to rent some farmland. He received seed funding from the regional revitalization promotion grant. And I understand that he learned agriculture from local farmers and help in developing sales channels from local businesses. “The entire community helped me.” An environment where the community as a whole supports young people’s challenges was the deciding factor for Mr. Harada in moving there. “Opportunities lie in local communities.” We will strongly support young people who think in that way and plunge into local communities outside the major cities. We will make it even easier for them to utilize the program that provides up to three million yen in cases when people move from Tokyo to other regions to launch a business or start a new job. We will establish migration support centers in 1,000 municipalities all around Japan and link the people’s needs to migrate into the actual people’s movement. We will establish a new scheme that matches talent with employment opportunities and provides assistance with transportation expenses in order to promote among urban residents second jobs and dual employment in areas outside the major cities. By expanding the “population with ties,” we will aim to link it to future migration and achieve our goal of balancing the number of people relocating to and from these places. We will further strengthen the creation of attractive jobs in areas outside major cities by expanding the tax incentive reduction scheme of corporate donations for regional revitalization. We will introduce special applications of the antimonopoly act so as to secure and maintain thoroughly local financial service and transportation service, which are the foundation of community development. We will also continue to support creativity and ingenuity of local efforts with the regional revitalization promotion grant. Together, let us build a new era for regional revitalization, in which young people can plunge into the future with dreams and hopes.4. The Growth Strategy(Owners of small- and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises) The “Witches of the Orient” played very dynamic volleyball. The balls they used were made by a small factory in Hiroshima. Over the course of the past half century, the high degree of skill used to manufacture them has been handed down over, with their balls continuing to be chosen even now as official volleyballs of the Olympic Games. Owners of small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as micro-enterprises of all over Japan are supporting local economies through unique technologies that have been cultivated over a great many years. However, many of them are now over 60 years old and the succession of their businesses is a matter of urgency. The largest wall blocking succession by the younger generation is the practice of personal guarantees. From this spring, we will prohibit in principle the seeking of a double layer of guarantees, in which personal guarantees are received from both the old and new business owners. Beginning this month, Shoko Chukin Bank has started lending that in principle does not require personal guarantees, to be applied to 30,000 cases annually, amounting to two trillion yen in new loans. The Credit Guarantee Corporations will launch a new program from April that guarantees the loans of succeeding business owners without a personal guarantee. They will also provide assistance to improve management by business successors and waive the guarantee fee for those who receive the confirmation by experts. With the strong determination to never carry down the practice of personal guarantee into the new generations, we will mobilize all possible measures. Seven years ago, the subcontracting promotion criteria underwent major revisions for the first time in a decade. We will revise them further and expand its coverage. We will include large companies in the metals industry and chemical industry to call upon drawing up voluntary action plans. We will also assign professionals with expertise in the trade practices of respective industries as “subcontract G-men” and work to further improve subcontracting practices. The advance of digital technology is an enormous opportunity for owners of medium, small, and micro enterprises such as the expansion of sales channels. We will enact a law to make digital transactions transparent and rectify opaque trade practices such as unilaterally raising the fees charged to have a storefront in an online mall.(Regulatory reform) The Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence—As the Fourth Industrial Revolution is bringing major changes, we will boldly advance regulatory reform of the digital era. Beginning this year, we will lift the ban on unattended autonomous driving and provide safe and convenient means of transportation to people living in hilly and mountainous areas. We will create a new driving license limited to “safety support cars” equipped with automatic brakes and work to popularize it. This is an era in which the volume of data that an AI analyzes affects competitiveness. We will lead the world of Big Data by anonymizing personal information and enabling detailed analyses of it. Various payment services using FinTech are being introduced. In light of this, we will fundamentally review regulations sectionalized with the business acts in financial services.We will encourage people to acquire an Individual Number Card and start the use of this card as a health insurance card by the end of next fiscal year. We will push forward with the digitization of every kind of administrative procedure and complete this transition by FY2024 for all procedures other than those requiring in-person verification. We will ensure the safety and peace of mind of consumers in response to the rapid changes due to technological progress. We will reinforce the protection of personal information, including by making it possible to suspend the usage of personal data. We will make tailgating subject to criminal penalties and thoroughly crack down on malicious drivers by setting up cameras along roadways. We will ban the flying of drones towards airport facilities and ensure the safety of flight paths.(Innovation) I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Prof. YOSHINO Akira for being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. We will make bold investments in the young researchers who will come after Prof. Yoshino to take the lead in the future. We will prioritize boldly the allocation of funds to young researchers so that they can devote themselves to challenging research with out-of-the-box thinking. By ensuring stable positions and establishing career paths that include study overseas, we will create an environment where young people can have dreams and hopes for the future as they delve deeply into the world of research. The key to outpacing the speed of change and creating value that has never before existed is entrepreneurship. We will assist investments by large companies to startups through the tax system and make a paradigm shift from the not-invented-here thinking. We will make research outcomes and technologies that have accumulated grow into new industries by encouraging investment to startups from national research institutes. The impact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will go beyond just the economy and have enormous impacts over every sector of society, including security. It is critical to implement efforts based on a national strategy. The foundational infrastructure is telecommunications. With our eyes looking ahead firmly on 5G, post-5G, and beyond, we will strongly support innovation through bold tax measures and budgets. We will strategically advance our efforts under global collaboration so as to provide safe and secure infrastructure. As for quantum technology which serves as the foundation for next-generation encryption and more, we will move forward in developing an innovation hub that brings together leading researchers and corporations from both within Japan and overseas. Japan will make full use of the technologies it enjoys and contribute to the new international project aimed at developing a space station orbiting the moon, manned exploration of the lunar surface, and other undertakings. With the future exploration of Mars and other endeavors also in our sight, we will work to expand humankind’s new frontiers. We must also change the state of education in the era of Society 5.0. From this year we will launch coding education in elementary schools. Within four years, we will prepare one IT terminal for each and every elementary and junior high school student. We will also advance education reforms of the new era by employing a variety of outside talent, including corporate engineers.(Abenomics) The new economic measures we recently compiled aims at creating a future with security and growt. By implementing those measures with a total scale of 26 trillion yen, we will take every possible precaution against downside risk originating overseas, including trade friction between the U.S. and China and the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, along with the restoration and reconstruction from natural disasters. The Japanese economy has grown by 13 percent over the last past years, and the tax revenue in the FY2020 budget is the highest in history. The amount of government bonds issued has been decreasing for eight consecutive years. Without economic revitalization, there can be no fiscal consolidation. . Maintaining this basic principle, we will continue to aim at realizing a surplus in the primary balance by FY 2025. Over the past six years, while the working-age population has decreased by 5.0 million people, employment has risen by 3.8 million people. In the midst of a labor shortage, the increase in the minimum wage was the highest ever under the current calculation method, with the national average surpassing 900 yen per hour for the first time in history. Currently, close to 90 percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises have increased wages. Now, with the employment environment changing for the better, we will expand at a stroke, intensively over three years, the employment of those of the employment ice age generation. We will implement all kinds of measures, including lifting the ban on job offers specifically targeting this generation, and expand opportunities to make use of their willingness, experience, and capabilities. In order to make it easier to take on second jobs and dual employment, we will clarify rules regarding working hours. We will revise the Act concerning Comprehensive Promotion of Labor Policies and press forward with reforms, calling on large corporations to disclose their ratio of mid-career and experienced worker hires and making it possible to have various flexible working styles. As our economy and society undergo significant changes, it is a necessity of the times that there be diversity in our lifestyles. Let us now make substantial improvements to Japan’s employment practices and, together, advance the work style reform.5. A society in which all citizens are dynamically engaged(A social security system oriented to all generations) From this spring, equal pay for equal work will begin atmajor corporations.As the wall separating permanent and non-permanent employment crumbles, we will further expand the enrollment of part-time works to employees’ pensions. We will gradually expanding this to small- and medium-sized enterprises with more than 50 employees, while assisting their efforts to improve productivity with making use of the monodzukuri grant, subsidies for introducing IT, and the micro business sustainability subsidies amounting to more than 300 billion yen and reducing the burden of social insurance paperwork. Eighty percent of the elderly wish to continue working even after age 65. The arrival of a 100-year life society is a major opportunity. We will ensure employment options up until the age of 70 for anyone with the desire to work. Placing such changes to our working style at the core, we will push forward with reforms, covering the entire spectrum of pensions, medical care, and nursing care. We will expand to age 75 the choice for when to begin receiving a pension. We will also conduct a review of pensions paid to older workers who are still employed so that incentives to work are not hindered. In 2022, the so-called first baby boomer generation will be at the advanced age of 75 or older. Putting a halt to the increase in the social security burden borne by the working generation is a matter of urgency. We will undertake a review in order to shift from contributions based on age to those based on ability. We will examine asking those aged 75 or older with more than a certain amount of income to newly pay 20 percent of their costs when receiving medical attention. Alongside this, we will limit the burden borne by the working generation by charging a fixed sum to consult a doctor at a large-scale hospital for the sake of strengthening the role of primary care doctors. Regarding medical and nursing care, we will strengthen preventive care in order to build a society where everyone can stay healthy and active. This year we will implement reforms, aiming at a social security system oriented to all generations, where everyone, from children to families with small children, the working generation, and then the elderly, can enjoy peace of mind.(Assistance for child rearing) We will continue to invest boldly in the future of children. Following upon making early childhood education and childcare free of charge since last year, from this April, higher education will become free for children for whom such assistance is truly needed. We have also achieved making private high school effectively free. We will create a society where all children can work hard towards their dreams, regardless of their families’ economic situations. We will push forward with preparing childcare arrangements and eliminate childcare waiting lists. Through our efforts thus far, last year the number of children waiting for childcare reached its lowest point ever since the surveys began. We will strengthen our efforts, calling on municipalities that still have not eliminated waiting lists to formulate an improvement plan corresponding to local childcare needs. We will provide seamless support for pregnancy, childbirth, and child rearing. By spring of 2021, we will establish in every municipality a comprehensive support center for families with small children. We will expand support for low-income single-parent families and further reinforce our efforts to build a society in which it is easy to raise children. Aiming to raise the birthrate to 1.8 children per woman, the level the public has indicated as desirable, we will confront the issue of the decrease in the birthrate, an issue increasing in severity, head on.(A society in which all citizens are dynamically engaged) In Japan, there are many women highly motivated and capable. If we are able to make opportunities for all women to be dynamically engaged and for the potential they hold to fully blossom, Japan’s economy and society will change completely. Over the past six years, the number of women in the Japanese workforce has increased by 2.9 million. The percentage of women in the workforce in Japan surpasses that of the U.S. for all age groups over age 25. The M-shaped curve is without question moving towards disappearing altogether. We will continue to raise high the flag of women’s dynamic engagement, and press further forward our efforts to create an environment in which women find it easy to work and expand the number of women leaders. In addition, we will undertake measures to tackle domestic violence and other efforts by providing assistance for privately-run shelters. We will create a society in which all people, whether women or men, young or old, people with disabilities or intractable illnesses, or, moreover, people who have failed before, can mutually accept their diversity and utilize their originality. That is also a society where everyone can demonstrate their abilities as much as they want. The realization of a society in which all citizens are dynamically engaged will truly be the key to overcoming our declining birthrate and aging society. We will strengthen our efforts in the area of public transportation towards a barrier-free society. We will develop a telephone relay service that those who cannot hear can communicate with sign language free of charge. We will strengthen the mechanisms in place to support the desire to work held by those with severe disabilities. “That ability will be limitless when honed.” Dr. NAKAMURA Yutaka was ardently involved for many years in employment for the disabled. “We must promote sports for the sake of the engagement in society of people with disabilities.” Thanks to Dr. Nakamura’s passion, in 1964, the Tokyo Paralympic Games became a reality. Since then, the Paralympic Games have come to be held every four years regularly. With Dr. Nakamura’s thinking handed down over time, these Games will return to Japan once more, after more than half a century. We will make this year’s Paralympic Games into magnificent Games that give people all around the world dreams and move their spirits. Let us together create a Japan that is the country where people with disabilities can live more vibrantly than anywhere else in the world.6. Diplomacy and security(Proactive Contribution to Peace) The first time Japan encountered the Olympic spirit was in the Meiji era. KANO Jigoro wrote about his excitement at that time as follows. “ bring harmony among the thoughts and feelings of the peoples all around the world, supporting world civilization and peace.” This year, the year in which the Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place, Japan will, under the banner of “Proactive Contribution to Peace,” sum up its postwar diplomacy and build Japan’s diplomacy for the new era. It will be a year which becomes the crucial moment for that. We will seek to settle the outstanding issues of concern with North Korea, settle the unfortunate past and normalize relations, in accordance with the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration. In working towards the resolution of the abductions issue, the most important issue, I am determined to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un myself, without attaching any conditions. Needless to say, we will thoroughly adhere our principle to act resolutely in order to safeguard the lives and assets of the Japanese nationals. We will cooperate closely with the international community, in particular the United States and the Republic of Korea. As the security environment in Northeast Asia becomes increasingly severe, our diplomacy with neighboring countries becomes of extreme importance. The Republic of Korea is naturally our most important neighbor, which shares fundamental values and strategic interests with Japan. It is for exactly that reason that we sincerely expect the ROK to uphold promises made between our countries and build future-oriented Japan-ROK relations. Visits to graves by former island residents by airplane and joint economic activities on the Four Islands, which President Putin and I agreed upon at Nagato, are both moving forward steadily. We will accelerate negotiations taking the 1956 Declaration as a base to resolve the territorial issue and conclude a peace treaty. This policy itself is unwavering. I am determined to achieve this with President Putin. Japan and China together share a major responsibility for the peace and prosperity of this region and the world. In the current situation in Asia, the international community strongly call upon us to demonstrate their commitment to fulfill such a responsibility. We will build a mature Japan-China relation in the new era, by expanding and deepening exchanges at every field in addition to mutual visits by the leaders.(Security policy) We will protect Japan’s territory, territorial waters and airspace, under any circumstances. Japan’s security policy solely rests on our own efforts. This spring, we will establish the Space Domain Mission Unit within the Air Self-Defense Force. Furthermore, in order to ensure our superiority in the new realms of cyberspace and electromagnetic waves, we will fundamentally strengthen our capabilities and our systems in these areas. Yesterday, we commemorated the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. The Japan-U.S. Alliance is now stronger than ever before. Under this deep relationship of trust, we will advance our work to develop facilities and other efforts, with a view to relocating U.S. Marine Corps force to Guam in the first half of the 2020s. While maintaining deterrence, we will deliver results one after another to alleviate the impact of military bases in Okinawa. On the robust foundation of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, we will aim to bring about a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” working together with countries with which we share fundamental values, such as European countries, India, Australia, and ASEAN member nations.(Addressing issues facing the international community) Over the past seven years I have visited 80 countries and regions and had a total of more than 800 summit meetings. I am determined that Japan will play a leading role in the world towards addressing common issues faced by the international community, grounded in my relationships with leaders of relevant countries. I am deeply concerned about the heightening in tensions in the Middle East. Japan calls on all parties concerned to resolve issues through dialogue and self-restraint responses. In light of the friendly relations Japan has cultivated until now with the countries of the Middle East, we will continue to engage tenaciously in diplomacy promoting peace that only Japan can do in order to ease tensions and bring stability to the situation in this region. As Japan relies on this region for a great deal of our energy resources, it will strengthen arrangements for information gathering by the Self-Defense Forces and ensure the safety of vessels related to Japan. As a standard bearer for free trade, we will spread the economic order of the 21st century to the world. We will swiftly launch trade negotiations with the UK, which will withdraw from the EU. We will lead the further expansion of the TPP Agreement as well as negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that include India. We will lead the creation of new international rules on data flow through the Osaka Track. The Osaka Blue Ocean Vision agreed at the G20 has already received the approval of 59 countries. We will aim to bring about the reduction of additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050 by expanding this trend further to the world. Japan has achieved reductions in its greenhouse gas emissions for five consecutive years. Our reduction of 11.8 percent compared to fiscal 2013 is second only to the UK within the G7. In order to achieve at an early time a carbon-free society as set out in our long-term strategy, Japan will inaugurate the International Joint Research Center for Zero Emission Technologies. We will aggregate knowledge from G20 research institutes in the U.S., the EU, and elsewhere, driving revolutionary innovation, such as artificial photosynthesis, aiming at “Beyond Zero,” whereby we transition to reducing the carbon dioxide that has continuously increased since the Industrial Revolution. The peace and stability of the world, developing free, fair, and open international rules, and taking on the challenges of climate change and other global environmental issues—let us together carve out the horizon for Japan’s diplomacy in the new era as we work to realize a better world.7. Conclusion “For humans dream thus only once in four years.”A movie recording the 1964 Games ends with these words. What kind of new era will we make? Realizing that dream depends on the actions of those of us alive today. We will advance major reforms associated with this nation’s vision, including social security. Now is the time for make actions, with the new era of Reiwa having just begun, the Olympic and Paralympic Games coming up, and prospects for the future being filled with positive dynamism. It is impossible to fulfill our responsibilities to the next generation by postponing things. It is the Constitution that tells us the nation’s vision. What kind of country should we aim to be as we head towards the future? It is the responsibility of us Diet members to put forth that proposal, is it not? Now that we have entered a new era, let us fulfill our responsibilities together in the Commissions on the Constitution, in order to look intently at the future and carry out our historic mission. We will create a Japan that shines on the world’s center stage, a Japan that we can be proud of and is brimming with hope. Over the last seven years I have given my all to moving towards that dream. We must not let dreams end as merely dreams. In order to build the Japan of the new era, let us all get started together, beginning here and now. Thank you very much for listening.

"2","Remarks by the Prime Minister, Marking the 60th Anniversary of the Signing of the Japan-US Security Treaty",2020-01-19," Mary Jean Eisenhower, Merrill Eisenhower Atwater, distinguished guests, today is a good day. We are here to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Mary, our grandfathers played golf together at Burning Tree Club, Bethesda, in June 1957, fostering a friendship between the two. Only a dozen years had passed since the end of the war, and the Prime Minister of Japan had come all the way from Japan to play what kind of golf exactly? My grandfather would tell me that the reporters and everyone around him showed tremendous curiosity in their eyes. “All right, the honor of Japan will hinge entirely on my very first shot,” my grandfather thought, his palms sweating. However, he would later tell me very proudly, the shot that made him most nervous in his entire golfing career turned out to be also the very best and most beautiful shot he ever took. Wow. There was a stir in the gallery, which erupted the next moment in thunderous applause, giving him a sense that Americans were fair, as he would also tell me later. KISHI Nobusuke was the first Japanese Prime Minister ever to play golf with the President of the United States. And the second? That would be… me. Four times. I’ve played golf together with President Trump no less than four times thus far. Although in my heart I consider that too to be evidence that the U.S.-Japan Alliance has deepened, never, of course, would I ever claim such a thing aloud. And our scores? We made a promise they would remain state secrets. The friendship Eisenhower and Kishi developed at Burning Tree, would come to bear fruit after 30 months of ripening, bringing about the new Security Treaty. * * * On January 19, 1960, at 2:40 PM Washington time, the signing ceremony began in the East Room of the White House, packed with a huge number of people, including of course the President and the Prime Minister. During the toast he made at the lunch just prior to the ceremony, President Eisenhower had said that it would have been a bit more productive to have had these conversations on the golf course, making Prime Minister Kishi smile. But the President began the ceremony more seriously, getting right to the crux, declaring the treaty indestructible. That was absolutely true. Today, more than ever, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is a pillar that is indestructible, a pillar immovable, safeguarding peace in Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and in the world, while assuring prosperity therein. My deep appreciation goes to all those people whose efforts have enhanced our alliance, day in and day out. To all the young Americans in uniform who dedicated their lives for the peace in Asia, whose numbers are countless, and whose names no one remembers, to all the officers and service personnel of the U.S. military who shared tears together with the victims when the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan... To all those, including generations of people in the JSDF uniform, who have spared no effort in making the alliance robust, all the people in both our countries, those heroes unnamed and unsung, I dedicate my appreciation. The efforts and the sacrifices they made gave us peace and prosperity. They made the bond of trust that binds our alliance steadfast and unwavering. * * * It was a happy dispensation of history, wasn't it? Preceding the signing ceremony by a century, in the year 1860, the First Embassy of Japan was in the same East Room, meeting President Buchanan to give him a letter of credence. Thus began the U.S.-Japan relationship. One hundred years later, Prime Minister Kishi, shoulder to shoulder with President Eisenhower, stood at the turn of one century to another. ""I hope,"" Kishi said in his remarks, ""that in the coming hundred years we will achieve even more progress toward a new relationship based on trust and cooperation."" As I have now turned the same age as my grandfather was at the time, I hereby make the same pledge. We have elevated the relationship to one in which each of us, the U.S. and Japan, protects the other, thereby giving further force to the alliance. Going forward, it is incumbent upon us to make it even more robust, to make it a pillar for safeguarding peace and security in both outer space and cyberspace. Let us keep and enhance the U.S.-Japan Alliance, while making it even more steadfast, shall we not, to make it a pillar safeguarding freedom, liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, one that sustains the whole world, sixty years, one hundred years down the road. The two leaders envisaged one hundred years to follow when they gave life to the U.S.-Japan Alliance, which, may I say, even at its outset, began as an ""alliance of hope."" There shall be only one way for us to walk onward. Our alliance being one of hope, it is for us to let the rays of hope keep shining even more. Thank you so much.","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202001/_00002.html"
"3","New Year's Press Conference by the Prime Minister (Opening Statement)",2020-01-06,"PRIME MINISTER ABE: Happy new year, everyone. We had clear skies over a wide area on the first morning of the new year, and I took in the beautiful sight of Mt. Fuji. Here at the start of the first new year in the era of Reiwa, I have just paid a visit to Ise Jingu Shrine. I prayed for the new era of Reiwa to be a wonderful one of peace and prosperity for Japan. This year the Olympic and Paralympic Games will return to Japan at long last after half a century. The bidding activities through unified efforts of the people of Japan bore fruit and, seven years ago, Japan was elected as the host of the Games. I still recall that immediately after the final decision was announced in Buenos Aires I made a statement that our dream will come true if we work together. Japan’s declining birthrate alongside an aging population and the rapidly changing international situation are very serious challenges that lie before us, who have entered the Reiwa era. If we all work together, however, our dream will come true. I am firmly certain that we will surely succeed in overcoming these issues and carving out a new era, by confronting them head on together with the Japanese people. Together with the Japanese people, I will make this historic year -- the year in which we will once again host the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- a year for carving out a new era for Japan. I have renewed my determination to do so here as we start the second year of the Reiwa era. Around 1964 when Tokyo last hosted the previous Olympic Games was a time when the so-called first baby boomer generation was entering the workforce en masse, becoming a major driving force behind Japan’s rapid economic growth. It was against that backdrop that Japan’s world-class universal pension coverage and universal health coverage took shape. Two years from now, however, in 2022, this baby boomer generation will be at the advanced age of 75 or older. With the declining birthrate and aging population becoming increasingly serious, if we continue on our current path, the social security burden borne by the young generation will rise dramatically. At the same time, average life expectancy has become almost 15 years longer than it was in 1964. Among the elderly, 80 percent have the desire to work even after they turn 65. The arrival of a 100-year life society is a major opportunity. We will take this occasion to build a society in which people can be active their entire lives, in which people can continue to work if they wish, regardless of their age. Simultaneously, those whose income surpasses a certain amount, regardless of age, will bear a degree of the burden, as supporters of social security. By doing so, I believe we will be able to hand down our social security system in which Japan takes pride to a new era, while limiting the increase in the burden borne by the young generation. In addition, we will expand the application of employee pensions to include those working part-time broadly. In the age of equal pay for equal work, we will eradicate from our nation’s vocabulary the expression “irregular work” in the world of pensions as well. Under this overarching principle, we will implement reforms to bring about a system that ensures the peace of mind felt by the working generation to an even greater extent. We will push forward with reforms to social security overall, including in the areas of pensions, medical care, and nursing, putting the changes in work-style at its core.. In this age of a declining birthrate, needless to say, we will also expand our assistance towards children and the childrearing generation. We will endeavor to create a society where all children can work hard towards their dreams, regardless of their families’ economic situations. Aiming at such a society, from this April, we will make higher education free of charge for children truly in need, following upon early childhood education and childcare becoming free of charge last year. In the new era of Reiwa, while keeping that future firmly in view, we will undertake reforms to bring about a social security system in which all generations can enjoy peace of mind. I consider this to be the greatest challenge for my Cabinet this year. This year is the Year of the Metal Rat (kanoe-ne) in the Oriental zodiac. The Rat (ne) is the first of the twelve signs in the Oriental zodiac, and the Year of the Rat is said to be one in which new buds start to spring forth. And, Metal (kanoe) includes the meaning of resolutely carrying out reforms while inheriting that which has existed until now. It is a year for advancing major reforms that will carve out a new era. The Year of the Metal Rat has historically been a year marked by such milestones. It was in the Year of the Metal Rat 60 years ago that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was revised. Japan overcame the East-West Cold War and has enjoyed peace and prosperity. The Japan-U.S. Alliance truly came to carve out the era that followed. Now, 60 years later, it has become the foundation of Japan’s diplomatic and security policies. Meanwhile, the world is now in the midst of a surge of major changes. Under the current circumstances, in which the East Asia security environment is more severe than ever before, it is of the greatest importance that of course Japan and the United States, as well as Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea, engage in close cooperation, and that Japan forge cooperative relations with Russia and China. We are unwavering in our policy of normalizing relationswith North Korea through resolving outstanding issuesof concern and settling the unfortunate past in accordance with the Japan-DPRKPyongyang Declaration. In working towards the early resolution of the abductions issue, the most important issue, I intend to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un myself, without attaching any conditions. Tensions are rising in the Middle East and the current situation is a cause for great concern. Further escalation of the situation should be avoided and I call upon all parties involved to make every possible diplomatic effort to ease tensions. Last month, I welcomed President Rouhani of Iran to Japan. Japan will continue to engage tenaciously in diplomacy that only we can do, so as to ease tensions and stabilize the situation in this region.. Japan relies on this region for many of our energy resources. In conjunction with these diplomatic efforts, in order to strengthen our system for gathering information, we will dispatch the Self-Defense Forces to this region to ensure safe navigation by vessels related to Japan. We will also continue with our efforts to further spread to the world an economic zone based on free and fair rules. Japan will also continue to demonstrate leadership as a standard bearer for free trade through our efforts to expand the countries joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement and through negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Under the vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, on the robust foundation of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, I intend to deepen further our cooperation with countries with which we share fundamental values, including the countries of Europe, India, Australia, and the members of the Association of South‐East Asian Nations (ASEAN), while taking a panoramic perspective of the world map. This year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, we will sum up Japan’s postwar diplomacy thoroughly and, on that basis, carve out the horizon for Japan’s diplomacy in the new era. I intend to make 2020 that kind of year. The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games are now a little more than half a year away. I want to press forward with all possible preparations to make these Games ones where the athletes coming together from all around the world can give their very best performance. And, I want this Games to be the one in which people the world over to be able to have dreams and hopes towards a new era. Finally, I would like to extend my sincere wishes that 2020 is a splendid year for each and every one in Japan. I will end my opening statement here.

"4","New Year’s Reflection by the Prime Minister",2020-01-01,"  Happy new year! The curtain has finally opened on the year of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. The 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games took place when I was 10 years old and I still have a vivid memory of watching them. The great achievements of the Japanese athletes, who held their own compared to physically larger foreign athletes, offered children hopes and dreams for the future. “People can grow because they have a dream. Being able to nurture a dream is essential, whatever the era.” These are the words of Tokyo Olympic Games weightlifting gold medalist MIYAKE Yoshinobu. The Olympic and Paralympic Games, which will return to Japan after half a century, will also enable children to foster dreams for the future. I want to make the Games into wonderful competitions that spark excitement in people. Last year, we celebrated the first succession to the Imperial throne from a living Emperor in approximately 200 years and the new era of Reiwa began. After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, five years from now the Osaka-Kansai Expo will take place. Our prospects for the future are now filled with positive dynamism. Now is the time to press forward vigorously with nation-building for a new era. Preschool education has become free of charge for all children aged three to five. From this spring, we will begin making higher education free of charge for children truly in need. We will invest boldly in the future of children, who will shoulder the future. The arrival of a 100-year life society is a major opportunity. We will push forward with work style reform and create a society in which all citizens are dynamically engaged, where each person is able to demonstrate his or her abilities, whether female or male, young or old, or a person with a disability or an intractable illness. We will advance reforms to bring about a social security system in which all generations can enjoy peace of mind. Moreover, we will squarely take on Japan’s declining birthrate alongside an aging population, the greatest challenge we face.  We will resolutely defend Japan’s beautiful sea, territory, and territorial airspace. We will continuously review our security policies, never becoming trapped by conventional thinking. We will overcome the rough seas of the rapidly changing international situation and carve out new horizons for Japan’s diplomacy, taking a panoramic perspective of the world map. Keeping an eye squarely on the future, we will advance major reforms associated with this nation’s vision. Beyond that lies constitutional amendment. Here, as we ring in the second year of Reiwa, I have renewed my determination to work towards nation-building for a new era. I ask the public for their further understanding and support towards the Abe Cabinet. I also send my heartfelt wishes for 2020 to be a magnificent year that brings joy and prosperity to one and all.  ABE Shinzo Prime Minister of Japan January 1, 2020 ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202001/_00001.html"
"5","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister (Opening Statement)",2020-02-29,"  The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading across the world. Following the outbreak in China, the number of infections is soaring in countries including the Republic of Korea and Italy. In Japan, while the outbreak has not been spreading to that extent, new cases of infections are being confirmed every day.  At this stage, it is possible to control the speed at which the outbreak spreads. That is the view expressed by experts this week. To that end, we will be at a critical moment over the coming one to two weeks regarding whether the outbreak spreads rapidly or is controlled. Based on such a view from the experts, I have determined that we must implement all possible measures over the coming two weeks to prevent the outbreak spreading further.  Preventing group infection is of extreme importance. In order to avoid the risk of large-scale infections, I call for responses such as canceling, postponing, or downsizing national-scale sports or cultural events where many people gather. There are cases of the infection spreading at fitness centers or buffet-style receptions. Please refrain from activities at places with poor ventilation or a high concentration of people as well as venues or formats in which an unspecified number of people are likely to come into contact with each other. We also request business operators to take sufficient measures to prevent infections.  We have already requested elementary schools, junior high schools and senior high schools as well as schools for special needs education to close temporarily from next Monday, until spring break. March is an important period for children as the end of school year, before they graduate or go on to the next stage of education. It is truly heartbreaking to put in place measures to close schools during this period when students make great memories with friends they spent the school year with. We ask schools to hold graduation ceremonies while implementing measures to prevent infection, taking all possible precautions such as limiting the number of participants to the minimum necessary.  The closure of schools would impose a burden upon parents. In particular, for families with small children, it will be a very significant burden. Nevertheless, prioritizing the health and safety of children above all, we must mitigate the risk of infection arising from large numbers of children, teachers, and staff staying together for long hours every day and spending time together in the same space. I ask for your understanding on this.  We must not allow to occur at school under any circumstances such situations as group infections spreading to children. With such determination, local authorities and everyone working in educational settings for exerting every effort to respond to this sudden request, and we are grateful for their dedication.  We ask private companies to take into consideration the situation of employees with children. In particular, the closure of schools will be a very significant burden for micro-, small- and medium-sized business operators, who already routinely face a shortage of workers, as well as medical professionals and nursing and childcare workers.  We will do everything possible to minimize that burden by putting into place, to the greatest possible extent, measures to provide care for small children. The government will do everything possible to support local government efforts including making the same arrangements at after-school care programs as during spring break. We also intend to establish a new grant scheme to squarely address the reduction in income resulting from parents taking leaves of absence from work, for both permanent and non-permanent workers.  As the one who made that decision, taking full responsibility, I am determined to thoroughly address the various issues that arise. We will also swiftly compile within roughly the next 10 days a second emergency policy package that utilizes this fiscal year’s contingency funds, which amount to more than 270 billion yen.  As the infections by the novel coronavirus spread worldwide, some concerns are emerging over the decrease in overseas tourists as well as on-going operation of production lines. As an exceptional measure, we intend to extend support dating back to January through the Employment Adjustment Subsidies, regardless of industry.  We will also create a mechanism to listen directly to the voices of micro-, small- and medium-sized business operators on the challenges they face and thoroughly address impacts on local economies such as by providing strong liquidity support.  Furthermore, taking this opportunity, from the perspective of preventing outbreaks, we will advance the use of remote work in every aspect of society, making full use of teleworking and other forms of IT, and all at once push forward with changes that go ahead of the times.  We will closely monitor the trends in the world economy, including the significant drop in stock prices across the board in major stock markets around the world. We will implement necessary and sufficient economic and fiscal policies in accordance with their impact.  In Japan, five patients have contracted and died from the novel coronavirus thus far. Six passengers who had been on the Diamond Princess have also died. I pray sincerely for the repose of their souls and extend my condolences to their families.  I understand that many people in Japan feel unease about this virus in various ways. Meanwhile, among those who have tested positive in Japan, including cruise ship passengers, more than 140 have already recovered and been discharged from hospitals. The assessment of experts is that even if people become infected with this virus, most cases will have mild symptoms and many patients will recover.  Furthermore, we are seeing reports that the duration of hospitalization is longer than for seasonal influenza. In particular, it is considered that elderly people and those with underlying diseases have a high risk of their symptoms becoming severe. Therefore, the government intends to put in place a solid screening structure and medical treatment structure so as to minimize the number of severely ill patients, while continuing to exert every effort to prevent the outbreak from spreading.  With respect to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, in addition to taking response measures at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, since last month we have been proactively supplying reagents and other test kits to local public health institutes, private-sector screening institutions, and universities across Japan and working to build their capacity in this area. As a result, nationwide we have the ability to conduct more than 4,000 screenings daily. We continue to provide reagents to private-sector screening institutions and universities in areas outside the major cities and are working to enhance their screening capacity further.  Regarding PCR screening, we are receiving many comments that health centers are refusing to conduct screening despite requests. While health centers are under the jurisdiction of prefectural governments or cities designated by government ordinance, the government has repeatedly requested that screening be conducted when a doctor suspects a case of infection. In addition, in order to prevent situations where patients cannot undergo screening due to limited screening capacity locally, the government will mediate among regions so that necessary screening can be conducted in each area without fail.  Within next week, we will have PCR screening covered by health care insurance. This will make it possible to request screening directly from private-sector screening institutions without going through health centers. The screening capacity of private-sector screening institutions will be also strengthened significantly.  In addition, we are working to develop new simple test equipment that will make it possible to reduce the time needed to detect the virus, currently two to three hours, to around fifteen minutes. Over the past month, we have been working to develop the reagent and improve its accuracy, and we intend to start using this kit within March.  We will utilize all such available measures and ensure sufficient screening capacity so that every patient can undergo PCR screening when a doctor nearby, such as a primary care doctor, deems it necessary.  From the standpoint of preventing symptoms from becoming severe, it is also necessary to secure hospital beds for treatment. While there are more than 2,000 beds designated for infectious diseases nationwide, we intend to ensure a capacity of over 5,000 beds, fully utilizing beds in Designated Medical Institutions for Infectious Diseases in an emergency situation. By providing support to hospitals so that they maintain all beds available at this moment, we will develop a medical treatment structure fully prepared for cases such that the number of patients increases significantly.  At this moment, there is no medication with confirmed effectiveness against this virus, as we have with influenza. That is the major source of global concerns. Therefore, at this moment, three types of medication, including Avigan, have been administered to patients in Japan, as observational studies to identify their respective effectiveness against the novel coronavirus. Basic studies using the novel coronavirus have already confirmed a certain degree of effectiveness for each of the three medications. We intend to dose patients with their consent and develop a cure as early as possible.  In facing a crisis, it is important to always assume the worst and prepare in advance. In Hokkaido, Governor Suzuki has declared a state of emergency and called upon the residents to refrain from going outside over the weekend. The Government will introduce the special application of the Employment Adjustment Subsidies and thoroughly support those who need to take a leave, including non-permanent workers. We will spare no effort and extend all possible cooperation including provision of necessary supplies.  We need to specify our response measures in cases of sudden surges in outbreaks in certain areas. This is the time for action. The government has already announced its basic policy, and we intend to swiftly prepare legislative measures aimed at minimizing the impacts on the daily lives of the public, while anticipating all possibilities. I intend to continue to implement necessary measures without hesitation, prioritizing protection of the health and safety of the public above all.  There are still many unknowns about this virus. Fighting an enemy hard to see and hard to understand is not easy. Speaking frankly, we cannot win this battle through the capacity of the government alone. As we work towards bringing this situation to its ultimate conclusion, it is indispensable to have the understanding and cooperation of each and every member of the public, including in medical institutions, households, private companies, and local governments.  Decisions that directly impact people’s lives will be met with various opinions and criticisms. It is a matter of course to listen sincerely to such voices as the prime minister.  At the same time, as the prime minister, I will safeguard the lives of the people, along with their daily lives. To carry out that great responsibility, I am determined to continue to stand at the fore making decisions on what we must do.  We should not prejudice what lies ahead on our way to ultimately settling this situation. A hard and trying battle will continue. We must also prepare for that and this will be a significant imposition upon the people. I once again ask most sincerely for cooperation from each and every one of you. However, I am confident that we can surely overcome this challenge.  Last but not least, to the medical professionals and others who have been devoting themselves since last month to fighting this virus on the frontlines, I express my sincere respect for your efforts, including the responses taken onsite at the Diamond Princess. I ask for your continued support in this fight.  I will end my remarks here.  ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202002/_00002.html"
"6","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister",2020-03-28,"Opening Statement The novel coronavirus disease is raging around the world. More than 500,000 people have been infected. It took more than 60 days to reach the first 100,000 infected, but most recently the number increased by 100,000 in a mere two days. It is spreading at a truly explosive rate. In several countries, the death toll from this disease has been increasing at a scale of hundreds per day for several days in a row, and adequate medical care is not being provided to the growing number of severely ill patients. A situation has emerged that can be called a collapse of the medical care system. This is most certainly not someone else’s problem. Japan could face the same situation in a short time. I once again ask the Japanese people to maintain the greatest possible vigilance, with that degree of a sense of urgency.  In Japan thus far, through the efforts of experts as well as public health center officials and other medical practitioners working on the frontlines, we have managed to somehow hold steady through the early detection and thorough control of transmission links in group-based infections called clusters. However, currently, there are a growing number of patients for whom the route of transmission is unknown, mainly in urban areas such as Tokyo or Osaka. When we are unable to trace the path of the infection, we cannot tell the scale at which infected people exist in the background. Moreover, if an uncontrollable chain of infections were to emerge, an explosive spread of infections could occur.  As for the possibility of this so-called “overshoot,” in Tokyo this week, Governor KOIKE Yuriko stated the metropolis is in a critical phase and called on the citizens of Tokyo to refrain from going out at night or on holidays, among other measures. Together with the governors of Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Yamanashi Prefectures, she appealed for voluntary cooperation in canceling events and refraining from going out into crowded places for non-essential or non-urgent reasons. In Osaka and Kumamoto as well, the public has been urged to refrain from going out this weekend. I would also like to make an impassioned request for citizens to cooperate with these requests from local governments.  Once an explosive spread of infections occurs, in only two weeks the number of infected people is estimated to soar to more than 30 times the current figure, based on the examples in Europe and the U.S. Should that happen, our strategy of delaying the peak by restraining the speed of infection as much as possible will immediately collapse.  Some may be thinking that the total number of infected people in Japan is still low compared to Europe and the United States. However, in light of the incubation period, among other things, the number of infected people we see every day is nothing more than a snapshot of the state of new infections roughly two weeks prior. That is to say, even if at this moment an explosive rise in cases had already occurred, we would not be able to detect it immediately. By the time two weeks pass and figures appear, the speed of increase in the number of patients would already be beyond our control. This is the most frightening aspect of this infectious disease. We must fight through to the end against this horrible enemy with indomitable determination.  With that strong sense of urgency, we mobilized the Self-Defense Forces to drastically reinforce our countermeasures at the borders. The day before yesterday, based on the amended Act on Special Measures, we took a Cabinet decision to establish a national headquarters for countermeasures. Through this decision, every prefecture has already established its own headquarters for countermeasures as well. Further advancing coordination with local governments, we will make every possible effort to prevent the spread of infection while also envisaging worst-case scenarios. I ask the public to refrain from all non-essential, non-urgent travel.  In order to reduce the risk of group infections, I ask once more for people to avoid to the greatest possible extent the so-called three conditions that enable group transmission. The first of these is closed spaces having poor ventilation. The second is places crowded with people. And the third is close conversations taking place at short distances. Closed spaces, crowds, and close contact. I ask the public to avoid these “three Cs.”  With schools reopening in the new semester, this week the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology set forth guidelines. By taking thorough measures at each educational facility to avoid these three conditions, such as to keep opening classroom windows for ventilation, the guidelines aim to be doubly sure in preventing children from becoming infected. With regard to schools reopening, I intend to once again convene an experts meeting next week and listen to opinions from experts’ standpoints. A little more than a month has passed since the experts expressed the view that Japan was at a critical moment. During this time, some things such as the three conditions to avoid have come to light. We have also asked the public to take on some heavy burdens such as canceling, postponing, or downsizing large-scale events. I thank the public sincerely for their cooperation.  Many people may have been feeling stress over the past month, with what can be called coronavirus fatigue or voluntary restraint burnout. However, in the U.S. and in some countries in Europe now experiencing an explosive spread of infections, there has been no alternative but to put hardline measures in place. These include putting cities into lockdown, imposing obligatory bans on people leaving their homes, and shuttering shops other than those providing daily necessities. We are currently imposing sizable inconveniences, but I ask for your understanding that they are intended to avoid more austere hardline measures of this kind.  As I mentioned earlier, under current circumstances, Japan, in contrast to Europe or the U.S., is still managing to hold steady by a very narrow margin. However, if we let down our guard even a little as a result, there is no telling when an abrupt escalation in cases could happen. Even though we have been fortunate enough to avert a radical increase in cases, that means our situation of being at a “critical moment” will continue for some time to come. It is imperative that the public brace itself for this fight to be a long-term battle. I state this in full candor and ask the Japanese people for their continued cooperation in preventing the spread of the infection.  In order to eliminate the public’s unease as soon as possible, the government will bring together wisdom from around the world and accelerate the development of effective pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines. During both the G7 and G20 summit meetings held via videoconferencing recently, I stated that point strongly and received the support of leaders around the world. In Japan we have already begun administering four drugs to patients as observational studies.  Among these, in dozens of cases thus far we have administered Avigan, which has been approved as a pharmaceutical treatment for novel influenza with side effects and other properties already identified. It is a drug preventing viral replication, and there have been reports that it has already been effective in alleviating symptoms. Many countries have expressed interest in Avigan, and from now, cooperating with interested countries, we will expand clinical research and begin to increase production of the drug. We also intend to launch the process of clinical trials, which is necessary for the drug to be formally approved as a therapeutic agent for the novel coronavirus disease. As for Remdesivir, developed as a therapeutic agent for Ebola virus disease, international joint clinical trials are starting, with Japan and the United States at the center. In addition, a fifth promising candidate, Futhan (Nafamostat mesylate), which has been approved as a pharmaceutical treatment for pancreatitis, is scheduled to begin being administered from now as an observational study to patients who have given advance consent.  Universities and private companies have started to engage themselves in developing pharmaceutical treatments, vaccines, and so on. Through providing robust support for these activities, the government will pursue a full range of possibilities. Amidst the unprecedented unease and fear covering not only Japan but also the entire world, it is my hope that Japan will light a flame of hope through its power of innovation.  We will take bold measures going forward to address the current economic situation, where we have fallen into a severe state never experienced before. Yesterday, the budget for the next fiscal year was passed by the Diet. As a result, from the new fiscal year we will be able to seamlessly execute the budget for such initiatives as enhancing social security, including medical and nursing care, and making higher education free of charge. In addition, after this, I will convene the national headquarters for countermeasures and direct it to formulate emergency economic measures. While it is an exceptional case since the financial shock created after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we will formulate a supplementary budget for the next fiscal year and submit it to the Diet as soon as possible. We intend to formulate and then move to implement an unprecedented, powerful policy package, introducing all possible policy measures such as reductions in national and local taxes as well as financial measures.  Seven times as of yesterday, I have listened directly to the voices of people in various workplaces and local areas. There has been an exceedingly enormous impact across the Japanese economy, arising alongside voluntary restraint regarding various activities and other factors. Bus reservations for next month are down by 90 percent year over year. The airline industry too is experiencing a drop in revenue that could cause the entirety of annual operating profits to vanish. There are many places where sales in the lodging and food service industries have plummeted by 80 or 90 percent. In the music industry, I heard some say that events have been canceled and sales are at zero or incurring losses. With uncertainty in their future, micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators told me heart-rending accounts describing the situation as a matter of life or death. At the same time, some have shared their determination with me, that they will grit their teeth and make their very best efforts to survive this ordeal.  The government will thoroughly provide support to respond to their plight and we will firmly protect employment and places to work in local communities. It is also critical to have the power of culture, the arts, and sports, which soothe people’s souls particularly in such a time as this. We must not by any means let the flame of culture be extinguished even in times of hardship. That said, in the current situation in which preventing the spread of infection takes the very highest priority, we will move forward with measures that place emphasis on overcoming this difficult situation first of all.  For micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators, we have already put into place bold liquidity support measures that are interest-free in real terms and do not require collateral, with repayment of principal deferred for a maximum of five years. We will also make it possible to take out these interest-free loans through private-sector financial institutions.  Furthermore, in order for business owners to overcome these difficulties, we will prepare not only lending but also a new subsidy. Mindful of the current severe situation, we will carry out unprecedented assistance for micro-, small-, and medium-sized business owners at a scale never seen before.  For families in which income decreases and there is a danger of difficulties cropping up in daily life as a result of reductions in work or other circumstances, we have already taken various measures such as small-scale financial support that could be exempted from repayment as well as grace periods for paying taxes and public utilities charges. In addition to these, we will boldly provide benefits to support daily life.  With the entire government working as one, we intend to listen to the voices of people in various circumstances and provide well-tailored assistance.  At the stage where the spread of infection is contained and we have swept away social unease, we will make the Japanese economy achieve a V-shaped recovery in one push. In every corner of the nation, in order to bring smiles back to people’s faces, we intend to provide support to bring about a robust revitalization by implementing bold and intensive demand stimulus measures in a short timeframe, covering travel and transportation, eating out, events, and more.  The world will work in cooperation to implement powerful economic and fiscal policies. This is the agreement we reached during the recent G20 summit. As a nation taking the lead in international cooperation, Japan will formulate a set of measures at a scale never seen in Japan before, surpassing the economic measures implemented after the financial shock that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  As for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, whose opening this summer has made our hearts beat faster in anticipation, has been unavoidably postponed, and we will hold the Games no later than the summer of 2021. For the athletes who have given their all with their sights set on this summer, I feel this is extremely regrettable, but I ask for their understanding, given the current state of affairs globally.  I want the Olympic flame that arrived in Japan last week to continue to burn here in Japan as a symbol of the hopes of humanity, and send it off resolutely when the day comes. This very Olympic flame is a light of hope, guiding humanity to a way out of the long and dark tunnel in which we now find ourselves. I will be absolutely certain to make next year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games a success, together with the Japanese people, as proof that humanity has defeated the novel coronavirus.  I will end my opening statement here.Watch Video  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202003/_00002.html"
"7","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister",2020-03-14,"Opening Statement Yesterday, an amendment to the Act on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and Response, related to the novel coronavirus disease, was enacted. Through this, if by any chance in the future the situation is deemed to have reached a state of emergency, it will be possible to take, based on this law, various measures to prevent the wide spread of infection and maintain societal functions. As we face this national crisis, we must transcend differences in political positions and carry out our responsibility to the people. I express my deep appreciation to all those concerned in both the ruling and opposition parties who shared this conviction and cooperated tremendously in conducting Diet deliberations and enacting the bill expeditiously. In the first place, the national government and local authorities are acting as one to avoid such an emergency situation arising, implementing relevant measures to prevent the spread of infection while asking the public to accept substantial difficulties and inconveniences. The purpose of this legislation is solely to prepare for the worst just in case, alongside these efforts. In determining the existence of a state of emergency, which could lead to the restriction of various private rights, we intend to make a careful judgment while also seeking out the opinions of experts. Currently, the number of infectious cases is trending upward. However, compared to other countries where the number of infected is increasing at a rapid pace, in Japan the speed of increase is holding steady. That is the view experts announced this week. While the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic this week, if we compare the number of infections per 10,000 people in the population, Japan stands at only 0.06. We have kept the number down to a low level compared to the Republic of Korea, China, 13 European countries including Italy, and three Middle Eastern countries including Iran. Given this situation, we have concluded that at the present time we are not in circumstances for declaring a state of emergency. That said, the situation is ever-changing. We will maintain a high degree of vigilance as we intently watch how the situation develops, and should it be necessary in order to safeguard the lives and health of the public, I intend to execute, in accordance with procedures, the measures provided for in legislation. === A little over two weeks have passed since experts indicated the view that we would be at a critical moment over the following one to two weeks regarding whether the outbreak spreads rapidly or is controlled, as I stated during the previous press conference. And at present, experts’ assessment is that Japan’s situation as of today is not moving toward an explosive spread of infections, and appears to be somewhat holding steady. I express my heartfelt thanks to all the Japanese people for the tremendous cooperation they have provided at their workplaces, at their schools, at home, and in their communities in preventing the spread of infections over the more than two weeks until now. Various kinds of sports tournaments scheduled for this month, including the spring National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament, have also been canceled. I can only imagine the great frustration felt by the students who devoted themselves to intense practice day in and day out, aiming at achieving a spot in those tournaments. I pledge to make my very best efforts to restore, at the earliest possible time, the day you can demonstrate your ability to the fullest in front of your families and classmates supporting you, and compete against your rivals fair and square. Yet despite that, the current situation is that we are still unable to let down our guard. I ask once again for your ongoing cooperation until the experts analyze our efforts thus far and release their conclusions. === While the novel coronavirus disease has had many unknowns, as we moved forward in the measures we have pursued until now, many things have come to be understood. According to the data compiled to date, 80 percent of people in whom infection has been confirmed and who are also symptomatic experience only mild cases. Even among people suffering severe cases, roughly half have recovered. Including cases from the cruise ship, more than 40 percent of those infected, amounting to some 600 people, have already recovered and have been discharged from the hospital. At the same time, those who died are concentrated among the elderly and those with underlying conditions. From this week we have begun distributing masks to nursing care facilities for the elderly around the country, and we need to make more such efforts towards preventing infection. We also consider it vital for us to concentrate our testing and medical care resources to prevent symptoms from becoming severe. Regarding the infectiousness of the virus, roughly 80 percent of those confirmed to have contracted the virus thus far have not infected other people. In other words, it is not the case that the infection will spread from person to person, one after the other. At the same time, in specific kinds of places such as fitness centers and live music bars, there have been reports of instances in which clusters of infections have been confirmed. The points in common are, first, that they were closed spaces with poor ventilation; second, they were crowded with many people; and third, that conversations and vocalizations took place in close proximity. Mass infections were confirmed where those three conditions were met simultaneously. Places where these three conditions meet simultaneously have a high risk of infection. I want everyone to be on guard against such conditions to the highest possible degree. I once again ask everyone to take actions to safeguard their own wellbeing. To rephrase this, we can lower the risk of infection by avoiding places where these three conditions meet simultaneously, or by taking measures so as to avoid as much as possible these three conditions arising at the same time. These two weeks, schools have not been in session and there may be a large number of children who have spent most of their day inside their homes. In order to maintain their health and relieve stress, do please make opportunities for them to go outside and get some exercise, in safe environments where, for example, care has been taken not to have people gather closely together. Regarding graduation ceremonies scheduled in the coming days as well, I very much hope that they are held, taking necessary precautions to ensure safety. Despite the strict conditions imposed, educational institutions around the country are undertaking truly diverse and unique arrangements to celebrate children’s once-in-a-lifetime graduations, such as enabling parents and guardians unable to attend ceremonies to participate online and having faculty play musical instruments to bring ceremonies without attendees to life. I appreciate those efforts. To all those graduating, please accept my congratulations. I feel it to be truly regrettable that schools were closed during this important period in which you would have made your final memories. The bonds of friendship you have cultivated with your teachers and friends will never fade. I hope you will continue to be highly successful, each following your own path, as you hold those bonds of friendship dear. === Creating places for small children to spend the day, providing allowances to parents who have come to have no choice but to miss work, and providing assistance to meal service providers and dairy farmers facing difficulties because school lunches have been canceled -- we incorporated responses to various problems such as these, which have arisen alongside school closures, into the second emergency response package decided this week. The novel coronavirus disease is causing enormous impacts on the economy overall. We understand that for micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, the situation is very serious, to the extent that it could affect business continuity. We must engage in all possible means to enable micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, which are the core of local economies, to continue their businesses. By doing so, we will firmly protect employment and places to work in these local areas, and I am determined to achieve this. In order to overcome the current challenging circumstances, we have made the Employment Adjustment Subsidies available to businesses in every type of industry. In addition, without being constrained by past practices, we have decided to implement at a national scale strong liquidity measures that are interest-free in real terms and do not require collateral. For liabilities that already exist, we are asking private-sector financial institutions to work on changes in loan conditions, such as grace periods for repayment, in a swift and flexible manner. As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we will do everything possible to shore up our preparedness, through 430 billion yen in budgetary measures and 1.6 trillion yen in financial measures. We have set up more than one thousand consultation centers nationwide, so by all means please provide us with feedback if any issues are encountered, such as a scheme being difficult to use. In light of increasing concerns over an economic downturn, we intend to introduce measures for the immediate future to assist people worried about their daily lives. As the infection spreads around the globe, markets worldwide, including in Japan, are shaky, and there are worries about a further downturn in the global economy in the future. We will continue to expeditiously implement necessary and sufficient economic and fiscal policies without pause. At present, our highest priority lies in preventing the spread of infection. Afterwards, we will in one burst put forward bold and unprecedented policies in order to return the Japanese economy once more to a solid growth trajectory and restore among the public smiling faces full of energy. We will hammer out those concrete measures through the all-out efforts of the national government and the ruling parties, thoroughly reflecting the current status of local economies. I want Japan to overcome the current difficult situation through listening to the voices coming from communities and from workplaces, with people in every corner of the nation acting with one mind, truly as one team. === In the latest package of emergency measures, we also incorporated measures aimed at preventing the spread of infection, the greatest issue we face. With respect to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, thanks to various efforts, we are now able to conduct accurate screening of more than 6,000 cases daily, a 50 percent increase since my last press conference. The development of rapid test kits able to screen cases in a short time is also progressing smoothly, and there are now prospects for being able to begin using a portion of them within March. We will also work to enhance our capacity further by providing assistance to introduce equipment in private-sector screening institutions. Thanks to these efforts, we expect our capacity to be expanded within March to reach up to 8,000 screenings a day. Making use of this, we will work towards early detection of and early responses to group infections, known as clusters, and work to link these to early diagnosis of the infected, preventing symptoms from progressing to a severe stage. It is a matter of great urgency that we put a medical treatment structure in place that is prepared for emergency situations. By further increasing nationally the number of beds in designated medical institutions for infectious diseases, we have already secured more than 12,000 available beds. Regarding ventilators, which are necessary in treating severely ill patients, we have secured 3,000 at present and, having established budgetary provisions, are now working to prepare more. Currently, there is no way forward other than tenaciously treating the symptoms of the infection, as no definitive medications or vaccines exist. That is the greatest cause of global unease. In the telephone talks I held with U.S. President Trump yesterday, we agreed to work in close cooperation in researching and developing pharmaceutical treatments. We intend to accelerate in one push the development of pharmaceutical treatments and other treatment methods by bringing together wisdom from around the world, including not only Japan but also the United States, Europe, and moreover the WHO. Japan will demonstrate leadership in this area. === The worldwide spread of the outbreak is still ongoing. As I mentioned earlier, what we are able to do right now is, first of all, to limit the explosive spread of the infection. By doing so, we will be able to provide appropriate medical care to all those suffering from severe symptoms and avoid what is called a collapse of the medical care system. Beyond that, we can delay the peak of the outbreak as much as possible. That will enable us to buy time until a pharmaceutical treatment or other treatment method is developed. While this will surely cause great difficulties for our nation, I ask for ongoing cooperation from each and every one of you. This is not a solitary battle waged only by Japan. The entire world is now confronting the novel coronavirus, our common enemy. Yesterday, after speaking with President Trump, I also confirmed cooperation with President Macron of France. Making use of the frameworks of the G7 and the G20, I intend for Japan to take the lead in the unified efforts of the international community, including those in economic policies. Humankind has been exposed to the threat of infectious diseases countless times until now, and we have overcome that threat every time. If the world joins hands, no difficulty will be insurmountable. Regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship, tomorrow, the quarantine response for all passengers and crew will be completed. Although this was an unprecedented mission truly fraught with difficulties, battling an invisible virus in a ship carrying more than 3,700 people, we are able to bring to a close our quarantine response to all those who were on the ship. I wish to extend my appreciation for the cooperation extended to us recently by various countries, such as by them dispatching charter flights to repatriate their nationals. In addition, I want to express my heartfelt respect for all those, including medical personnel, who made all-out efforts over a month and a half, quite a long time, in a severe work environment. I have the highest confidence that, as long as we join forces, we will be able to overcome any and all difficulties, bar none. I will end my opening statement here.Watch Video  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202003/_00001.html"
"8","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister regarding the Novel Coronavirus",2020-04-17," Ten days have passed since the declaration of a state of emergency was issued. During this time, every morning, some people have opened their stores and stocked shelves with food items and other daily necessities. Others have operated checkout registers or worked to deliver goods around the clock so that there would be no disruptions in the flow of goods. I extend my sincere thanks to all those who have continued operating their businesses to protect our daily lives even during this state of emergency. At nursing facilities for the elderly, childcare centers, and other such places, many staff members continue providing care for those who need it, paying careful attention to preventing infections. If such social infrastructure as electricity, gas, and water supply, garbage collection and incineration, and railway operations are not maintained properly, our daily lives cannot be sustained. Without such people working so hard day and night to make our daily lives possible, we could not win the long-term battle with this virus. I express my sincere appreciation to all such people supporting our fight against an invisible and frightening enemy. And, I wish to once again thank the public for responding to our request to refrain from going out as a step towards achieving our target of reducing people-to-people contact at least by 70 percent, or ideally 80 percent. Business operators have also cooperated tremendously by having people work from home in principle and other efforts. However, the number of new cases of infection each day has not yet reached a decline. In Tokyo, today reports of new infections have surpassed 200, the highest figure to date. It is a very severe situation. The number of people out on weekdays in urban areas declined by roughly 60 percent in the area surrounding Shibuya in Tokyo and roughly 70 percent in the area surrounding Umeda in Osaka compared to before the spread of the infection. We have still not reached the reduction target. Unless we achieve our target of reducing people-to-people contact by at least 70 percent, or ideally 80 percent, it will be difficult to shift the number of new cases of infection per day dramatically into a decline. The cumulative number of cases is already approaching 3,000 in Tokyo. In Osaka as well, the number has topped 1,000. Although efforts are now underway in various places around the country to have patients with mild symptoms recuperate in hotels and other such accommodations, medical facilities are sending out cries of desperation. Even lives to be saved -- lives that can be saved -- may no longer be able to be saved. With the risk of infection always present, the physical and mental burden on doctors and nurses working on the frontline is reaching its limit. I once again make a request of the public. Please refrain from going out. Avoid coming into contact with others to the greatest possible extent. That will protect people at medical facilities and safeguard a large number of lives. It will also lead to protecting you and the people you love. Everything depends on the actions each one of us takes. Yesterday, I expanded the area covered by the declaration of a state of emergency from seven prefectures to the entire country. With the endorsement of the experts on the Advisory Committee, including the chair, Dr. OMI Shigeru, the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters took that decision. At present, group infections called clusters have been confirmed in areas all around Japan. Regarding these clusters, the experts’ analysis is that people easing up on their efforts to curb the spread of infection over the three-day weekend in March and the movement of people from urban areas to other areas may have spread the infection nationwide. In addition, some have pointed out that, while the governors have made such requests as for businesses to close temporarily in the seven prefectures including Tokyo and Osaka, the movement of people to regions outside those prefectures, which can be called a corona exodus, is being observed. We will soon be heading into the Golden Week holiday period. We must by all means avoid a situation arising in which people from urban areas with a large number of infected people flow into to other regions. That will certainly give rise to a nationwide and rapid spread, the situation to be feared most of all. As I stated during last week’s press conference as well, in those regions, there are many elderly people, who are said to have a high risk of developing severe symptoms. A rise in the infection risk will impose significant strains on community medical care, and by extension, this may result in tremendous impacts on people’s daily lives and the national economy. In order to avoid such a situation, in advance of the string of holidays, it will also be necessary to request tourist facilities to close down temporarily in various areas. To prevent the flow of people, an influx of people, we have now expanded the scope of the declaration of a state of emergency to the entire country so that those regions can take necessary emergency measures. To this end, the duration of the declaration will remain unchanged, to May 6, when the Golden Week holidays end. For another 20 days from now, all of Japan must unite as one to battle this virus. I intend to join hands with all of the prefectures and take all possible means to protect people’s health and people’s lives. As we extend the declaration of a state of emergency to cover the entire nation, we now ask for the cooperation of all citizens. The impact of this infectious disease is dragging out, with all citizens now finding themselves in austere circumstances. With a battle over the long haul also anticipated, the most crucial thing for us in getting through the battle with this virus is a sense of unity among the citizens. We will overcome this situation together with the citizens. With that determination, we have decided to provide a cash payment of 100,000 yen per person for all citizens nationwide. We had planned a measure to provide a cash payment of 300,000 yen to each household in need whose income has declined significantly, but in light of the various opinions voiced by the citizens and by the ruling and the opposition parties, we have decided to further expand the scope of those eligible for support. By doing so, the total amount of cash payments will expand significantly, from the scale of 6 trillion yen to more than 14 trillion yen. As this involves reformulating the supplementary budget, it will require roughly one additional week. I ask for cooperation towards swift enactment by the Diet. In the process of reaching there, some confusion has arisen, and I myself take responsibility for that. I extend my sincere apologies to the citizens. As circumstances shift dramatically day to day, I will listen carefully to the voices of the citizens and do my very utmost to make the best decisions at all times, placing the highest priority on their health and their daily lives. I am determined to continue fulfilling that responsibility. Cooperating with local governments and the institutions in charge of executing this measure, the government will work together in all-out efforts to enable the cash payments to reach to the hands of the citizens as soon as possible. When the fixed-sum stipend was distributed to everyone nationally during the financial shock following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the work just to send out the information to everyone in the public took as much as three months. For that reason, this time, placing importance on speed and avoiding people rushing to apply thus heightening the infection risk, we intend to have application procedures conducted by post or online, not in person at municipal offices. As the areas subject to the declaration of a state of emergency have expanded, those who are in tourism, restaurant businesses, and the event industry are being affected significantly. We will also speedily implement cash payments to businesses. Among local governments that have requested businesses to close temporarily, there is some movement to distribute payments individually in exchange for cooperating with the shutdown requests. As the national government, we will provide nationwide broad support not only to businesses that were requested to shut their doors and complied with that request, but also to businesses whose sales have declined as a result of this infectious disease. The national government will provide cash payments of up to 2 million yen to small- and medium-sized enterprises and up to 1 million yen to individual business owners, including freelancers. Also, there are many businesses whose tax payment deadlines are coming soon. By deferring the payment of taxes and social security premiums, we will enable business operators to use those cash reserves to continue their businesses. The government will use every possible means to support business operators who, in this tough time, are now truly gritting their teeth and making their best efforts and desperately move forward doing all they can. Your efforts will not be made in vain by any means. Let us overcome the state of emergency together. Recently the emergence of clusters within hospitals and hospital-acquired infections have been reported one after another, and I am very concerned by this situation. All the doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, and hospital staff as well as the clinical technologists and the public health center workers -- it is people like them who are on the front lines at this very moment taking on the battle with the virus in harsh environments fraught with the risk of infection. In order to tackle the current situation, the national government will act in cooperation with local governments to deliver to medical sites medical protective equipment necessary for preventing infections as much as possible. We will procure medical gowns, high-performance protective masks, and other such equipment through the full cooperation of the business community. Beginning this week we have implemented an early lifting of restrictions on online medical consultations, including initial consultations. In order to reduce the risk of infections occurring within hospitals, I would like everyone to utilize telephone or online consultations. We will establish testing centers in cooperation with medical associations located throughout the country. When deemed necessary by a primary care doctor, samples will be taken directly at these centers and be sent to private-sector testing institutions, thereby reducing the strain placed on public health centers and other facilities. The national government has also mobilized a total of more than 13,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces thus far, in order to confront the current severe situation. They have provided support by transporting patients with mild cases to accommodations run by local governments and conducting other operations. We will work to reduce the burden on medical sites by concentrating medical care resources on patients with severe symptoms. At this very moment, doctors, nurses, and medical practitioners are going all out to provide treatment in order to save the lives of seriously ill patients and protect people’s lives. We will work to improve worker benefits including doubling medical fees. We can express our heartfelt feelings of respect and appreciation to those working diligently at the front lines. In various locations nationwide, communities are making efforts to express their appreciation to medical professionals dedicating themselves to confronting the current severe situation by giving them rounds of applause and by illuminating various sites at night. Thank you very much for those efforts. Meanwhile, there is something more we can do. That is not only to face up to the reality in front of us, but also to change the future. By all of us avoiding going out for non-essential, non-urgent reasons now, we will be able to reduce dramatically the number of new cases of infection two weeks from now. That will undoubtedly lead to a reduction in the burdens placed on medical sites. What determines the conditions at medical facilities two weeks from now is, truly, what we do right now. The future depends on our actions at present. In order to support medical professionals, please reduce the burden imposed on them. Change the future through the power of everyone taking action. I ask for everyone’s cooperation amidst this state of emergency. I will end my statement here.  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202004/_00002.html"
"9","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister Regarding the Declaration of a State of Emergency",2020-04-07,"Opening Statement At first, I wish to express on behalf of the Japanese people our heartfelt appreciation to doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, and hospital staff, as well as to the public health center workers, experts, and medical technologists who have been working on counter-cluster efforts. I commend wholeheartedly the dedicated efforts being made with a strong sense of responsibility at this very moment in order to save the life of even one more person, right at the front lines of the fight against the novel coronavirus. In this harsh battle against the virus, more than 60,000 people have already lost their lives globally. The presence of medical workers armed with dependable techniques and a strong sense of mission encourages all of us. I thank you all sincerely. We will take all possible courses of action to support you as you give your very best, unafraid of the severe situation fraught with the risk of infection. We will do everything we can to protect your workplaces at medical facilities. We are pushing forward with increasing the domestic production of medical supplies critically important in preventing infections. We will further strengthen the supply system through assistance from other industries, including electronics manufacturers. Patients with mild or no symptoms will recuperate at lodging facilities or similar places rather than at medical institutions, thereby reducing the burden on medical institutions. Through the cooperation of hotel chains, we have secured 10,000 rooms in the Kanto region and 3,000 rooms in the Kansai region. The Nippon Foundation is also pressing forward in constructing a temporary facility. We will use these rooms and this facility to be able to devote medical assistance to patients with severe symptoms, thereby maintaining hospital functions. However, even with many such efforts underway, the number of patients is soaring, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka. The number of available beds for treatment is clearly approaching the limit. With the increasingly heavy burden on healthcare workers, both physically and mentally, medical sites are truly in a critical situation. In the current situation, we have not reached a state of a rapid and nationwide spread of the virus. However, in light of the fact that medical systems in some areas are being stretched, we have reached the conclusion that there is no more time to lose. We have determined that this situation could cause significant damage to people’s daily lives and to the national economy. Today, Dr. OMI Shigeru also joins us at this press conference. With the Advisory Committee’s endorsement, I declare a state of emergency, in accordance with article 32 of the Act on Special Measures. It will take effect in the four prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama in Kanto, the prefectures of Osaka and Hyogo in Kansai, and the prefecture of Fukuoka in Kyushu. In Tokyo, which has the highest number of patients, the national government plans to refurbish facilities for the Olympic and Paralympic Games before the end of April, preparing facilities that can accept about 800 patients with mild symptoms. With this declaration of a state of emergency, if necessary, it will also be possible to mobilize at these facilities medical staff from the Self-Defense Forces and elsewhere and utilize these locations as provisional medical facilities pursuant to article 48 of the Act on Special Measures. What is most important to reduce the burdens on medical care is not allowing the number of patients to increase. And, the most critical element in making that happen is citizens changing their behavior. While authority under the Act on Special Measures is exercised entirely by the governor of each prefecture, we believe the respective governors should call on the citizens of the four prefectures in Kanto, as well as the citizens of Osaka, Hyogo, and Fukuoka, based on clause 1 of article 45 of the Act on Special Measures, to refrain from going out frequently, except when necessary to maintain daily life. The situation is becoming increasingly urgent. The cumulative number of patients in Tokyo has surpassed 1,000. Recently, the number of patients has been increasing at a rate of doubling every five days. If the infection continues to spread at this pace, two weeks from now more than 10,000 people will be infected, and a month from now that number will top 80,000. However, according to an estimate by the experts, if all of us make efforts and reduce opportunities for person-to-person contact by a minimum of 70 percent, or ideally 80 percent, we will cause the increase in the number of patients to reach its peak two weeks from now and shift over into a decrease. By doing so, we believe not only will we avoid an explosive increase in infections, but also the possibility of containment through counter cluster measures will emerge. I ask people to refrain from going out, aiming at a 70 to 80 percent decrease, for the limited period of one month between now and the end of Golden Week holidays on May 6. This includes time for us to assess its effectiveness. As I mentioned earlier, freeing ourselves from this state of emergency a month from now is premised upon reducing person-to-person contact by 70 to 80 percent. This is no easy task. Until now we have been calling on the public to implement teleworking among other efforts. We ask you to work at home in principle, except for those jobs needed to sustain societal functions. Even in cases where going to the workplace cannot be avoided, I ask all businesses to implement measures such as reducing the number of workers present in the workplace by at least 70 percent through introducing rotating work schedules or other means; staggering work schedules; and maintaining sufficient distance between people. For the operation of restaurants and the like, I also ask owners to take measures such as thoroughly ventilating indoor spaces and ensuring that customers keep a distance from each other. While schools will remain closed for a longer period, we will work in cooperation with local communities to accelerate the development of environments in which learning can be done online or through other means. We have lifted the ban on medical consultations by telephone or online, including for initial consultations. We will avoid the situation such that those who are afraid of the risk of infection at hospitals hold back from consulting with a doctor, by having them use such services. On that basis, I again ask people to firmly avoid the three Cs—closed spaces, crowded spaces, and close-contact settings—when going into public is unavoidable, such as going out to buy daily necessities. As has been the case until now, there is no problem whatsoever with going outdoors to take a walk and go jogging. Meanwhile, please refrain from going to bars, nightclubs, karaoke parlors, and clubs with live music, where the three Cs overlap in a more concentrated way. I also ask people to avoid gatherings and events and to refrain from holding not only get-togethers for drinks but also dining with large numbers of people other than family members. The frightening aspect of this infectious disease is that many people who have contracted it have no fever or other symptoms whatsoever, and it spreads by them infecting people around them without anyone realizing it. I would like everyone, in particular young people, to think that you yourself might be infected. Whenever you head out, we ask you to take such actions as avoiding crowded spaces, maintaining distance between yourself and others, and wearing a mask to avoid spraying droplets around. Such actions will protect the lives of other people, and by extension, they will also serve to protect your own life. I ask for everyone’s cooperation in this regard. Since we are introducing state of emergency measures, we cannot avoid causing enormous impacts on economic activities. Needless to say, a large number of micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators have been facing significant difficulties in continuing businesses. It is no exaggeration to say that both the global economy and the Japanese economy are now truly facing the greatest crisis in the post-war period. With that strong sense of urgency, we will protect employment and daily lives of citizens at all odds. Towards that end, we have decided to implement economic measures at a scale of 108 trillion yen, equivalent to 20 percent of our GDP, which is even one of the largest in the world. We will provide a total of over 6 trillion yen in cash payments to families and to micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators now facing difficulties. In addition to 300,000 yen per household, we will provide an additional 10,000 yen per child when we disburse the next child allowance payment, providing firm support for the finance of families with many children. The backbone sustaining the Japanese economy is micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses. The business owners who are now gritting their teeth and making their best efforts now in the midst of this truly tough time present Japan’s underlying strength. Your voices are reaching us. We must not allow your efforts to come to naught. It was through that belief that we established the very first cash payment to business owners in Japan’s history. For businesses whose sales have dropped significantly, we will provide 2 million yen to small-, and medium-sized corporations as well as those relatively larger corporations and 1 million yen to individual owners. We will also reduce property taxes. We will also defer the payments of social security premiums for one year along with consumption tax and other tax payments. Of course, no penalties will be charged. By implementing deferments at a scale of 26 trillion yen, we will make it possible for those business operators to use those cash reserves for continuing their respective businesses. Interest free in real terms, unsecured, loans with principal repayment deferred for a maximum of five years will be also available from private-sector regional banks, shinkin banks, and credit unions as well. Moreover, we will raise the subsidy rate of the Employment Adjustment Subsidies to the highest level ever in history. We are determined to overcome this, the greatest crisis of the post-war period, together with the people by mobilizing all other conceivable policy instruments. This declaration of a state of emergency does not in any way intend to close cities or a lockdown as we are seeing take place overseas. I state that clearly. Trains, buses, and other forms of public transportation will continue to operate. We will under no circumstances particularly block off roads, and in the view of the experts, there is no need whatsoever for such measures. Overseas, when cities were put under lockdown, there were some places where a large number of people slipped out of the cities, resulting in havoc and a spread of infection. Right now the greatest thing we should fear is fear itself. It is still fresh in your memory that false rumors spreading on social media resulted in a shortage of toilet papers in stores. I am just like all of you in feeling a deep sense of unease at the invisible enemy of virus. At such times, as social media is by nature a tool for deepening bonds between people and giving rise to solidarity in society, I believe that it has tremendous power to reduce societal unease. At the same time, it could also cause panic on the basis of misinformation driven and spread by nothing other than fear. In such cases, it causes enormous harm upon our economy, our society, and our lives that surpasses the risk of the virus itself. In the view of the experts, even in the current situation, the infection risk in Tokyo or Osaka is not high at all, assuming citizens lead their normal lives while refraining from going out for non-essential, non-urgent reasons. The situation is entirely different from the cities overseas where lockdowns were imposed. Therefore, I ask the public to refrain strictly from taking actions such as moving to local areas outside these cities. There are many elderly people in these areas and they are said to have a high risk of developing cases that becomes severe. I ask you not to heighten their risk of becoming infected. Needless to say, we will properly maintain societal functions. Through cooperation with local governments, services that support people’s daily living, such as electricity, gas, telecommunications, finance, and garbage collection and incineration, will continue to operate as usual. I ask for the continued cooperation of those working at nursing care facilities for the elderly, day care centers, and other such places, for the sake of those in need of these services. Those engaged in the manufacture and processing of food products and other daily necessities, those involved in distribution, and those working in retail will continue operating dependably. Therefore, I wholeheartedly ask everyone to take level-headed actions based on accurate information. Our lifestyles have changed completely over the past two months. Live music events we had been looking forward to have been canceled. Going out drinking with friends has been called off. We can’t go to the places we want to. We can’t get together with our friends. Our previous ways to spend a typical day have vanished. But through your actions like these, it is certain that many lives are being saved. I appreciate sincerely the cooperation of each and every citizen. Quite frankly, we cannot overcome this state of emergency through sole efforts by the national and local governments. This is an undeniable fact. Will we be able to avoid an explosion of infection cases? Will we succeed in bringing as many people as possible back from the brink of death? Will we be able to protect you and the family members you love? All of these depend on the actions you take. I ask for your cooperation once more. Even in the midst of total uncertainty and great unease, hope is unmistakably emerging. The development of vaccine and therapeutic medicines are advancing, putting together wisdoms of companies and researchers across Japan and around the world. Avigan has been approved as a pharmaceutical treatment for novel influenza with side effects and other properties already identified. It has already been administered in more than 120 cases and we are receiving reports that it is effective in alleviating symptoms. We intend to expand to the greatest possible extent its administration to patients wishing to take it, within the framework of observational studies. To make that possible we will increase our stockpile of Avigan to three times the current level, enough to treat two million people Companies all around Japan have indicated they will cooperate to produce the raw materials necessary to increase domestic production. Car manufacturers are helping to increase the production of ventilators. Airlines suffering from a series of canceled flights have offered to assist in sewing the gowns needed for medical facilities. People are working to deliver homemade masks to help children attending reopened schools. There are truck drivers working around the clock, even now, at this very moment, to keep physical distribution functioning properly in order to supply supermarkets with daily necessities. There are people who have launched crowdfunding efforts in the hope of providing any assistance they can to medical treatment facilities. The Nursing Association is now calling for cooperation from more than 50,000 nurses no longer working at medical facilities. I too wish to ask them for a helping hand. As we face this national crisis, I want to ask everyone for help in battling the virus. In fact, responding to the call from the Nursing Association, some nurses have already offered to return to medical fields in order to protect and save lives. There are people standing up all around Japan in every business field, wanting to do whatever they can amidst this crisis. This is our hope. Nine years ago, we experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake. A great many people lost their precious lives, wounded and lost loved ones. What brought hope to us in those heartbreaking and difficult days were the bonds of friendship between people and the spirit of helping one another that appeared from all around Japan. Now, we are once again facing great hardship. But if all of us join forces, we are able to move forward once again with hope. We can absolutely prevail in our battle with the virus and overcome this ordealof emergency. I say this with great conviction. I will end my statement here","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202004/_00001.html"
"10","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister regarding the Novel Coronavirus",2020-05-25,"  As I begin my remarks, I once again pray for the repose of the souls of each one of those who have lost their lives because of the recent infectious disease. I also extend my sympathy to all those who have been infected. Today, we will lift the declaration of the state of emergency across the entire country. The number of new cases has dropped below 50 nationwide in recent days and the number of hospitalized patients, which at one time approached 10,000, has fallen to under 2,000. We made the assessment that the entire country had cleared the standards for lifting the state of emergency, which had been set recently at an extremely rigorous level, even from a global standard. Having received the endorsement of the Advisory Committee on the Basic Action Policy, we will take that decision at the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters meeting to be held after this press conference. Since March, an explosive increase in infections has occurred in the United States and Europe. Globally, more than 100,000 new infections are being confirmed on a daily basis, and some countries have undertaken lockdowns and other enforcement measures over more than two months. In Japan, even when a state of emergency is declared, it is not possible to implement compulsory restrictions on leaving the house that carry penalties. Nevertheless, by adopting an approach particular to Japan, we have succeeded in bringing the current wave of infections almost to an end in as little as a month and a half. I believe this has truly demonstrated the strength of the Japan model. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all citizens, who have been persevering with patience in their cooperation until now. I also express my deep respect to all our healthcare professionals, including the doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, and clinical engineers, as well as public health center workers and clinical technologists, who have done their utmost, with a strong sense of mission, despite a severe environment where the risk of infection is always present. Japan’s responses to this infectious disease are an outstanding model for the world. Last Friday, Mr. António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, commended Japan’s efforts in this way. In Japan, we have contained the number of infections and fatalities per capita to an overwhelmingly small number among the G7 countries. Our efforts to date are certainly yielding good results, giving hope to and attracting the attention of the world. From here today, we will take a strong step forward together with the people towards the next stage after the complete lifting of the declaration of a state of emergency. Our goal is to create a new normal for our everyday lives. From now on, let us change our mode of thinking. If we continue our approach of severely restricting socioeconomic activities, our jobs and daily lives will no longer be sustained. In order to protect our lives, what is needed now is to take a new approach and restore daily socioeconomic activities. Cultural and artistic events such as concerts and plays enrich our hearts and comfort us. The image of top athletes doing their best gives us dreams and moves us. I think many people eagerly await the day they once again set out on sightseeing trips all around Japan, too. While keeping a close eye on the state of infections, we will restore that kind of daily living little by little and step by step next month and the month after that. We also laid out today a concrete path forward for bringing that about. Professional baseball and other sporting events will resume next month, first without spectators, then gradually increasing the number of people attending. We intend for concerts and other kinds of events to start from roughly 100 people attending, and then we will increase that number step by step as we keep an eye on the state of infections, expanding to a scale of 1,000 in the audience, then 5,000, then still further to half the venue’s capacity. For all kinds of activities, we will reopen at a full scale on the premise that measures will be taken to prevent infections. Rather than not hold such events because of the risk of infection, we believe that it is critical to have the mindset of how we can hold events while controlling the infection risk from now on. As for schools, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has already set out guidelines for reopening, including staggered school attendance. A series of guidelines on measures to prevent infections, specific to over 100 kinds of industries, are signposts for reopening business activities at full swing and creating a new normal in our daily lives. We would like business operators to refer to these guidelines and get their operations going at full scale. The government will support the reopening of operations for local restaurants and other micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators by providing support to cover, for example, 100% of the costs of infection-preventing measures consistent with the guidelines, through subsidies of up to 1.5 million yen. Even when we act in full compliance with the guidelines, we cannot reduce the risk of infection to zero. We must be prepared to go through some trial and error. It will take quite some time as we follow the path to restoring our daily lives completely while holding down the number of infections. Even at this very moment, a truly significant number of business operators are facing turmoil that brings their business to the edge. Against such a backdrop, taking additional time is a matter of life and death. I am painfully aware of that fact. And yet, we can now see hope. The way out has come into view. Moving towards that exit, we will, together with the people, surmount this steep path forward. We must protect businesses and employment at any cost. Grounded in that determination, the day after tomorrow, we will decide upon the second supplementary budget. In combination with the earlier supplementary budget, the measures will exceed 200 trillion yen in scale. Through those measures at a scale totally unprecedented at 40 percent of GDP, the largest scale anywhere worldwide, we will thoroughly defend the Japanese economy from this crisis of once a century. We will carry out powerful liquidity support surpassing 130 trillion yen in total. Whether it be major corporations leading the overall economy, small- and medium-sized enterprises that support local economies, or those in between which have become the driving force of growth through their unique technologies, we will provide capital funds, such as subordinated loans or investments, to companies no matter their size, through the Development Bank of Japan and public-private investment funds. The provision of loans that are interest free in real terms with principal repayment deferred for a maximum of five years, provided by local banks, shinkin banks, credit unions in local communities, and other institutions, is also progressing. We will make every effort to get assistance into the hands of those who need it, at the earliest possible moment. With regard to such assistance for financing companies, the Bank of Japan decided on a new assistance program totaling 75 trillion yen last week. In addition, moving forward, the government and the Bank of Japan will work in tandem to put into place a full spectrum of measures to bring the situation to an end. That determination was announced as a joint declaration of the two, a rare occurrence. We will inject an overwhelming amount of funds through a truly “all Japan” approach and comprehensively support the financing of Japanese companies. We will boldly reduce the burden of fixed costs, an urgent matter in ensuring business continuity. As a special measure, we will raise the subsidies to be applied to personnel costs to a maximum of 15,000 yen per day, an amount at the most generous level anywhere worldwide. We will also establish a new scheme enabling those who are employed to receive cash directly. We will newly create a subsidy of up to 6 million yen, to reduce rent burdens on commercial properties. With regard to the Sustainability Subsidy (Subsidy Program for Sustaining Businesses), which provides up to 2 million yen in cash, entirely unrestricted in the purpose of its use, we will expand the scope of eligible recipients such that startups newly founded this year can also make use of it. We will increase funding for the Extraordinary Regional Revitalization Grant by 2 trillion yen to make it possible to provide assistance for business operators in a manner well-suited to circumstances in each local area. We will restore the Japanese economy by shooting our three arrows as powerfully as ever at the target of a new normal for our everyday lives in the age of the coronavirus. Economic revitalization will remain the first and foremost agenda item for the Abe administration among its policies. There is, however, one point I must emphasize, namely that even after the state of emergency is lifted, the virus will certainly remain present around us. Just as people once let down their guard and fail to maintain their vigilance against the virus or take precautions against infections, the infection spreads in one big wave. This is the most frightening aspect of this virus. We will restore socioeconomic activity while we take thorough measures to prevent infection. Doing both of these successfully at the same time is an extremely difficult challenge and the possibility of the next wave of infection is always present. During the past month or so, the people have maintained appropriate levels of concern over the virus and have cooperated in making the necessary modifications in their behavior. Citizens are washing their hands diligently and most people now wear a mask when they go out of the house. They are putting into practice efforts to avoid the “three C” by, for example, putting distance between one person and the next in line in the checkout lanes at stores. I am convinced that if such ways of carrying out our new lifestyle continue, we will be able to avoid the worst situation. Regarding restaurants where staff entertain customers, bars or nightclubs, clubs with live music, and other establishments in night entertainment districts, where the three Cs overlap in a more concentrated way and group infections have been confirmed to date, we express our appreciation for your cooperation. With the cooperation of experts, we intend to provide support so that relevant guidelines are compiled by roughly the middle of June and effective measures to prevent infection can be taken through the use of subsidies up to 2 million yen. Until then, I ask you to continue to take actions to protect yourselves. Even while building up such efforts, there is still a possibility that the speed of infections will increase and, in the worst-case scenario, a second declaration of a state of emergency could unfortunately be issued. Nevertheless I hope to avoid as much as possible those approaches that restrict socioeconomic activities, such as refraining from going out. If we dramatically decrease the risk of infection outside hospitals, that will be achievable. Towards that end, it will be necessary to further strengthen counter-cluster measures that identify infected people as early as possible. The key to this approach is the introduction of a contact-tracing app. It is an app aimed at early intervention, with the telecommunication function between smartphones automatically notifying users who have spent a certain period of time with those who have tested positive. In other words, it automatically notifies those with a high likelihood of having been in close contact with infected people. According to a simulation released by Oxford University last month, the study they conducted concludes that if these kinds of apps are popularized to reach almost 60 percent of the public and lead to the early identification of people who have had close contact with infected persons, lockdowns will be avoidable. In Japan, we plan to introduce an app at roughly the middle of June that does not collect personal information and thus can be used with peace of mind. I very much hope that many people make use of this. At the same time, we will continue to work to strengthen our screening capacity such that testing will be conducted right away when doctors deem it necessary. While we have already begun using antigen testing, we will move forward in expanding our PCR testing functions, including by making use of testing equipment at universities, in addition to providing support to private-sector testing institutions. We will also reinforce the structures for taking samples. Aside from dedicated outpatient facilities, we have already established close to 100 PCR centers all around the country, through the cooperation of medical associations, and we will expand this further. We will also build up a budget of over 2 trillion yen and work in cooperation with local authorities to enhance medical systems. We will designate medical institutions around the country that will intensively admit novel coronavirus patients for treatment and, in preparation for the possibility of a future wave of infections, properly secure a sufficient number of designated hospital beds. We also intend to provide benefits of up to 200,000 yen each to medical practitioners, hospital staff, and workers at nursing care facilities making great efforts on the front lines in this battle with the virus, in addition to extending our heartfelt appreciation towards them. With regard to high-performance protective masks, medical gowns, and other such personal protective equipment as well, we will make use of the Internet to directly grasp the situation at nearly 8,000 medical institutions around Japan and strengthen the distribution of such items by the government. Making the best use of this opportunity when the state of infections has settled down, we will accelerate various efforts and make all possible preparations against the possibility of a subsequent wave of infections. Turning our eyes to the rest of the world, we see that infections continue to spread even now. Against that backdrop, we will take the decision during today’s meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters to further strengthen our border controls. There will now be more than 100 countries subject to denial of entry. In the present day, with substantial globalization of economies, an interruption in the movement of people causes mortal damage to the global economy. The strict lockdowns in Europe and the United States have also resulted in production and other economic activities coming largely to a standstill. There can be no robust revival of the Japanese economy without the restoration of the global economy. Even if infections have settled down domestically, the situation will not truly become resolved unless the global spread of infections is curbed. We must not be absorbed in addressing issues in our own country exclusively. I believe we cannot resolve this global issue from its roots through an inward-looking mindset. However, countries where infections are increasing have no such luxury. Many of the countries that have until now led the world’s political and economic realms are now fully occupied by their domestic responses. That is the reality. We must not under any circumstances relax our guard. Precisely because we are in such a moment, we will adhere firmly to the universal values of freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law. And, Japan should, in a free and open manner, lead the world’s infectious diseases controls, working hand in hand with countries that share these values. We intend to propose at the G7summit scheduled for next month the establishment of a patent pool that will enable developing countries to utilize pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines against this virus under a highly transparent international framework. Regarding personal protective equipment, over the past several months we have been working to increase our domestic production. Building up a resilient supply chain in a globalized world, rather than relying on particular countries, is also an issue of vital importance. Making use of Japan’s experiences to date, we will demonstrate strong leadership as we create global measures against infectious diseases and a global order in the age of the coronavirus. That is Japan’s responsibility within the international community. I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people at the next stage after the state of emergency is lifted. I will end my opening statement here.  ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202005/_00003.html"
"11","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister regarding the Novel Coronavirus",2020-05-14,"    Today we decided to lift the declaration of the state of emergency for 39 prefectures, which excludes four prefectures in the Kanto region, three in the Kansai region, and Hokkaido. That assessment was made by drawing up, in cooperation with the experts, three objective criteria for lifting the declaration, including specific figures and other aspects, namely, the state of infections, medical treatment structures, and surveillance structures. We decided to examine comprehensively factors such as new infections trending downward when comparing the situation between the previous two weeks, the total number of infected people being held down to less than 0.5 people per 100,000 in total this past week, and additionally the state of new cases whose routes of infection are unknown. In light of these criteria, we judged that all 39 prefectures have successfully suppressed the spread of infections to a level at which prevention is possible by thoroughly implementing counter-cluster measures going forward. We also consider the medical care situation to be improving, given that, for example, the number of patients with severe symptoms is decreasing, while the testing system is functioning adequately in order to assess the trend in the number of new cases of infections. With the endorsement of the Advisory Committee on the Basic Action Policy, including Dr. OMI Shigeru, chair of the committee, regarding this evaluation, we have decided to lift the declaration of a state of emergency in 39 prefectures effective today, moving the end date forward from the end of May. We will take that decision at the meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters to be held after this press conference. In the remaining eight prefectures, in addition to the significant decrease in the number of cases of infection, the number of patients with severe symptoms requiring ventilators has also decreased in Tokyo and Osaka to roughly 60 percent compared to the peak. However, we still consider there to be an ongoing risk. We ask for citizens’ continued cooperation in refraining from going out and other efforts, without letting down their guard. We also ask citizens to refrain from travel to areas outside their respective home regions. On the 21st, one week from today, we aim to once again have the experts assess the situation at that juncture in light of criteria we have just decided for lifting the declaration and rescind the declaration if possible, without waiting for the 31st. I once again express my respect for the devoted efforts of our healthcare workers. Thanks to the all-out care they provide, the number of patients who left the hospital or otherwise recovered from this infectious disease has now surpassed 10,000 people in total. The situation of our medical system that has been stretched is also improving as a whole. The number of new cases of infection nationwide, which had increased at one time to almost 700 a day, is now moving forward at a level below 100 per day. Over the past month, this figure has decreased to less than one-seventh of its former level. All of this is the result of the actions of each citizen who cooperated with the request to refrain from going out and so on. I once again extend my heartfelt appreciation. And through the lifting of the declaration of a state of emergenc y in many areas, today is the day to make a full-fledged start towards creating a new normal for our everyday lives in the age of the coronavirus. Based on advice from experts, over 80 kinds of industries, including restaurants and other eating establishments, department stores and shopping arcades, shops of various kinds, movie theaters, theaters, museums, art museums and other kinds of cultural facilities, public transportation, and also hotels and Japanese-style inns, compiled guidelines today for preventing infections in their respective fields. These are guidelines for protecting the workers at those places from the risk of infection, as well as guidelines that allow consumers to use these services and facilities with peace of mind. We would like business operators, starting from the areas where the declaration has been lifted, to conduct business at full swing while referring to these guidelines. We would like to create together a new normal for everyday life. That being said, no guidelines can reduce the risk of infection to zero. Even after the state of emergency is lifted, the virus will certainly remain present all around us. In late February, Hokkaido declared its own state of emergency, which succeeded in reducing the number of cases of infection there significantly; however, about two or three weeks after the state of emergency was lifted in mid-March, the number of cases again began an upward trend. In Germany as well, there were areas where the number of cases began increasing immediately after restrictions on people’s actions were eased and a return to lockdowns became unavoidable. Even in Singapore, which was initially said to have succeeded in suppressing the spread of infections, the number of cases later increased dramatically. In the Republic of Korea too, many of you have seen the news that a group infection arose at nightclubs last week. Just as people let down their guard, the infection spreads in one big wave. Right when everything is brought back to the way it used to be, the infection spreads in an instant. This is the most frightening aspect of this virus. We have three requests to make of people in the areas where the declaration will be lifted, so that we do not let the efforts made thus far go to waste. The first is to start little by little, step by step. We will no longer ask those of you in the areas where the declaration has been lifted to refrain from going out. Nevertheless, at the beginning, we would like you to continue to do your best in reducing direct contact with people as much as possible, by, for example, avoiding face-to-face meetings with others or using the telephone for conducting business whenever you can. Even in the areas where the declaration has been lifted, we ask that you refrain from crossing prefectural borders as much as possible, at least until the end of this month. We ask that you bring your regular day-to-day lives back gradually. The second request is to continue positive changes as much as possible even after this. In the case of office work, teleworking has become popularized over the past month, thanks to many people’s efforts. We ask you to keep making these constructive changes, while improving what needs to be improved. Efforts such as staggered commuting hours are also effective in averting congestion, and we very much hope that you continue these efforts into the future. The third request is not to let down your guard against the virus in any aspects of your daily lives. In addition to of course being diligent about washing your hands, maintaining sufficient distance from others at all times and avoiding crowded spaces. When heading out, you should be sure to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others as much as possible, and opt for outdoor over indoor settings and avoid closed spaces. We ask you to avoid those three Cs in all aspects of your daily lives, referring to the new lifestyle proposed by the experts. In particular, we would like to ask you to continue to refrain from visiting restaurants where staff entertain customers, bars or nightclubs, karaoke parlors, and clubs with live music in night entertainment districts, where the three Cs overlap in a more concentrated way. As all of these are places where group infections have been confirmed thus far, we reiterate our request that you take actions to protect yourselves. We will suppress the spread of infections by this virus while simultaneously restoring socio-economic activities at a full scale. Nothing could be more difficult than this. Efforts by each and every individual are more essential than ever. On the premise of living our everyday lives with the virus -- the premise that the virus will be present around us -- we will restore our normal jobs and our day-to-day living while controlling the infection risk as much as possible. We will need to firmly establish a new normal for our everyday lives over time, through experiencing occasional trial and error. The world has yet to find any solution that assures us all will be fine if we do this or that. We must be ready for what could be a long road ahead. If that is the case, during that time, we must protect at any cost employment and our daily lives. We will advance step by step along the path to a new normal for everyday life together with you. To this end, it is necessary to introduce measures that are one step stronger; that is our assessment. To reinforce the recent supplementary budget at a scale of 117 trillion yen, the government will immediately start formulating a second supplementary budget. I will give instructions on this at the meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters held after this press conference. In order to protect the livelihoods of those who had to temporarily close their businesses, we will fundamentally enhance the Employment Adjustment Subsidies. We will raise the amount of subsidies from what had been capped at just over 8,000 yen per day to 15,000 yen per day, an amount at the most generous level anywhere worldwide, as a special measure. Furthermore, we will establish a new scheme enabling those who are employed to apply directly and receive cash directly. The worldwide spread of the infection has no end in sight. The global economy is facing a very crisis that comes only once in a century, beyond comparison with the financial shock after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even world-leading major corporations are suffering significant damage. Against that backdrop, it is absolutely imperative to prevent a situation where a chain of bankruptcies occurs. We will firmly support the business continuity of major corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in between by further strengthening liquidity support and, if necessary, making it possible to inject a sufficient scale of funds in a flexible manner. As of the first of the month, we began accepting applications for the Sustainability Subsidy (Subsidy Program for Sustaining Businesses), which provides up to two million yen in cash, entirely unrestricted in the purpose of its use, to micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators. We started disbursing funds to applicants one week later by having thoroughly simplified the procedures. This week alone, we have provided a total of more than 100 billion yen in cash to more than 80,000 SMEs and individual business owners. We will further accelerate such efforts along with providing loans interest free in real terms with principal repayment deferred for a maximum of five years, to enable them to survive cash management issues expected at the end of the month. In addition, as the impact of the infectious disease is lingering, we will also establish a new subsidy program to reduce rent burdens. We will vigorously support micro-, small-, and medium-sized operators, the core of local economies, in continuing their businesses by introducing all possible means, including a subsidy of up to 1.5 million yen to support next steps in their businesses such as introducing infection prevention measures. We will also expand significantly grants for local governments to support their efforts against this infectious disease. We will work in close cooperation with local governments and make all possible preparations to prevent the next wave of infections from happening to the greatest possible extent and, should it occur, minimize the impact of the wave as much as possible. When doctors deem it necessary, testing will be carried out immediately; an antigen testing kit that received pharmaceutical approval yesterday will be a major weapon in that arsenal. Antigen testing utilizes the same mechanism as influenza testing, which many of you have experienced at hospitals. Unlike PCR tests, which require up to six hours, results are available in a mere 30 minutes or so, making it easy to identify positive cases at medical facilities. When the virus is present in large amounts, the detection sensitivity of antigen testing is equivalent to that of PCR tests. We expect that identifying highly infectious people at an early time will be greatly effective in preventing the spread of infection. We expect that next month testing kids will be supplied for 20 to 30 thousand people per day. We will utilize these in combination with the PCR tests in use thus far to strengthen our screening capacity in terms of both volume and speed. With regard to PCR tests, we will accelerate our efforts to introduce screening using saliva. Compared to the method in use until now in which samples are taken from the back of the nasal passages, we expect that it will significantly reduce the risk of infection for those administering the tests and contribute to an increase in the number of tests administered. We will do everything possible to create a structure to conduct tests smoothly when a doctor deems testing necessary. By doing so, we intend to suppress the spread of infection in communities to the greatest possible extent. As for Remdesivir, approved as a therapeutic medicine for patients with severe symptoms, we have secured the amount necessary to treat patients with severe symptoms nationwide, and we have begun administering it at medical institutions. Regarding Avigan, if its effectiveness is confirmed, we will aim to have it approved within May. Moreover, Futhan (Nafamostat mesylate), Actemra (Tocilizumab), and Ivermectin are all drugs Japan discovered. Their side effects and other properties have already been identified through their use as therapeutic medicines for other illnesses, and given that fact, their safety upon prescription has already been confirmed. Clinical research and trials are already underway and, once their effectiveness in treating this infectious disease is confirmed, we intend to aim for early pharmaceutical approval. Insofar as the advantages of each drug differ, we also expect to see further therapeutic effects by combining them in an effective way. While minimizing or delaying the wave of infections to the greatest possible extent to avoid explosive increases in infections, we intend to establish effective methods of treatment as early as possible. The possibility of another wave of infections always exists. Shifting our socioeconomic activities into full swing towards a new mode for everyday lives naturally heightens that risk. Without each of us maintaining adequate vigilance, there is no telling what the future holds for us two weeks from now. If the rate of increase in the number of cases rises, a second declaration of a state of emergency is also a possibility. We are laying out our approach in making such a decision. If we have the cooperation of the public, we will be able to avoid such a situation. In late February, I made the request for schools all around Japan to close temporarily and for refraining from holding large-scale events. We placed tremendous burdens on the people, but as a result of that, we succeeded in holding down the first wave of infection arriving from China. That has been inferred from a genome analysis conducted by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. I thank you for your cooperation. Through your efforts for more than a month now, we are now also suppressing the second wave, which came from Europe and the United States. We have succeeded in curbing Japan’s number of infections per capita and number of fatalities to become overwhelmingly limited among the G7. This is an objective fact clearly borne out by the numbers. This is all thanks to the cooperation extended by all of you. We have been imposing significant inconveniences. I believe people are accumulating considerable stress as their daily lives with numerous restrictions continue for quite some time. But, our efforts to date are most definitely yielding good results. Now, we are poised to restore our socioeconomic activities at a full scale, while simultaneously preventing the spread of infection. We will take the first steps to tackle the extremely difficult challenge of creating a new normal for our everyday lives. I am firmly convinced that with the cooperation of the public, we will most certainly overcome even this challenge. I will end my remarks here.    window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202005/_00002.html"
"12","[COVID-19] Press Conference by the Prime Minister regarding the Novel Coronavirus",2020-05-04,"    Soon it will be a month since we issued the declaration of a state of emergency. We set a target of reducing people-to-people contact at least by 70 percent, and ideally 80 percent. Mindful of this target, the people have made considerable efforts, including by spending their time at home as much as possible. As a result, the number of cases nationally, which at one time had increased to almost 700 a day, has recently fallen to roughly 200 per day, a reduction to one-third of the previous level. This means that we are advancing steadily along the path leading to containment. The latest effective reproduction number, which indicates the number of people to whom an infected person spreads that infection, is also less than one. In early April when we declared a state of emergency, there were some pessimistic forecasts for a month into the future that an explosive surge of infection would occur, as happened in Europe and the United States. But the actions taken by the citizens are changing our future for certain. In Japan, even with a state of emergency declared, it is not possible to have, for example, compulsory restrictions on leaving the house that carry penalties, as in Europe and the United States. And yet we avoided the spread of infection and succeeded in shifting over to a decline. This is the result of efforts made to the maximum extent possible by each and every citizen through strong resolve. I wish to express my sincere thanks to all the people who extended their cooperation. At the same time, I must tell you in full candor that we must continue these kinds of efforts for some time to come. At the current time, we cannot yet say that the reduction in cases has reached a sufficient level. Nationwide, close to 10,000 people are still recuperating at hospitals or other facilities. The number of patients receiving treatment through ventilators has tripled over the past month. Given the fact that such severely ill patients need much time to recover, the reality that healthcare workers find themselves in harsh conditions will not change. More than 500 people have lost their lives to the infection until now. I extend my heartfelt condolences on their deaths. In order to save as many lives as possible, it is imperative that we concentrate medical resources further on treating severely ill patients. We must reduce the number of new cases per day to an even greater extent. While every day nationwide more than 100 people are being discharged from hospitals and otherwise recovering at present, we must further reduce the number of new cases to a level below the number of daily recoveries. Towards this end, to the citizens of the 13 prefectures with a large number of cases, thus requiring particular vigilance, I ask for their continued cooperation to avoid people-to-people contact by ideally 80 percent. In Tokyo, even now in May, on average more than 100 cases are being confirmed daily. I ask that people not let down their guard now, so that the efforts they made thus far do not come to naught. And, to prevent infection spreading nationwide, we must avoid doing any activity that would give rise to a flow of people to areas outside the major cities. In order to take measures to that end, we have decided to extend the duration of the state of emergency nationwide. It is said that inpatients at hospitals have an average stay of two or three weeks. While holding the number of new cases down at a low level, we will work to enable infected patients to be discharged from care. By taking such an approach, it is estimated that about one month will be necessary to improve the pressing situation facing our medical facilities. Regarding this approach, today, with the endorsement of the Advisory Committee on the Basic Action Policy, including Dr. OMI Shigeru, chair of the committee, we have decided to extend the declaration of the state of emergency for the entirety of this month, until the end of the month. In the meanwhile, ten days from now, on May 14, we will ask the experts to assess the situation again at that moment. When reassessing the situation, we ask the experts to analyze in detail the trends in the number of cases in each area, the degree of pressure being put on medical treatment structures, and other factors. If at that juncture it is deemed possible, we will lift the state of emergency without waiting until the end of this month. I want to apologize to the public for being unable to end the declared state of emergency in the one month originally planned. As the impacts of the disease become prolonged, micro-, small-, and medium-sized business operators, who support 70 percent of employment in Japan, now find themselves in an unprecedentedly harsh business environment, in which sales have gone to zero because of temporary business closures and other reasons. We are painfully aware of the hardships. Against that backdrop, it has been heartrending to make the decision to extend the state of emergency for another month. We recognize that we must deliver cash as soon as possible, entirely unrestricted in the purpose of its use, to those struggling even to make payments due tomorrow. On May 1 we began taking applications for the Sustainability Subsidy (Subsidy Program for Sustaining Businesses), which provides up to two million yen in cash, and the first of these cash payments will begin on the 8th. Unsecured loans up to 30 million yen that are interest free in real terms with principal repayment deferred for a maximum of five years will be available from not only the Japan Finance Corporation and Shoko Chukin Bank but also local banks, shinkin banks, and credit unions. We will also provide grace periods for paying taxes and social security premiums. We want everyone to make use of these support measures to get through this state of emergency in one way or another. Fully determined to protect businesses and employment to the end no matter what, the entire government will make full-out efforts with a sense of urgency to deliver assistance right to business owners. With respect to reducing the burden borne by restaurants and other such businesses to pay rent, further expanding the Employment Adjustment Subsidies, and supporting students working part-time now in a severe situation, we will expeditiously put additional measures in place, in line with the discussions undertaken by the ruling parties. In addition to that, what business operators hope for most of all is, we believe, the full-scale reopening of businesses. In order to make that a reality, we must contain the current infections within this upcoming month. May is the month for containment and a time to prepare for the next step. I ask for your understanding and your cooperation. Preventing the spread of infection is an absolute prerequisite for protecting our lives. Until effective remedies, effective methods of treatment, and vaccines are established, we must continue efforts to prevent the spread of infection. In that sense, it is critical for us to be prepared for a battle that is prolonged to a certain degree. However, if we continue conditions that severely restrict socioeconomic activities like now, our daily lives cannot be sustained. In order to protect lives, we must create as soon as possible a new normal for our everyday lives in the coronavirus era. We will move forward step by step together towards our everyday jobs and everyday lives as well as an exit beyond the state of emergency, premised on the existence of the virus. From that viewpoint, the experts proposed today basic points to bear in mind within our daily lives. In every aspect of our day-to-day lives, we should avoid the three Cs of closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings as much as possible. We should restore our daily lives, keeping in mind the characteristics of this virus and maintaining appropriate levels of concern over them. The new mode for daily life set out by the experts will serve as a guide for that. Children have put up with many things, with their schools closed for quite some time and them being unable to meet their friends or play outside sufficiently. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Tremendous burdens have also been placed on their fathers and mothers and other family members. Last week, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology set out new guidelines that including, among other measures, staggered school attendance. We will restore children’s school lives, even if it is stage by stage. We will promote efforts to create a new normal in school life as well. We will create a new normal for our economic activities too. With the new mode for daily life as a point of reference, we request that the reopening of various shops, restaurants and cultural facilities, as well as the holding of relatively small-scale events, be conducted through fully implementing measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as social distancing between people. Within the next two weeks, we intend to formulate more detailed guidelines for each industry on measures to prevent infection, in consultation with experts so that we can fully relaunch business operations. That said, I ask that everyone continue to refrain from heading to places where group infections have been confirmed to date, such as restaurants where staff entertain customers in night entertainment districts, clubs with live music, and other such places where the three Cs overlap to a significant degree. At the same time, it is not the case that going outside is itself bad. Maintain sufficient distance from others and wear a mask. It is fine to go outside when taking such precautionary measures. We will restore such daily routines based on the advice from the experts. To reiterate, going outside does not, in itself, cause problems. With the major premise of avoiding the three Cs, we will create a new normal for our daily lives together with the public. May will be a month of moving forward, straight towards that exit. At the same time, we will prepare thoroughly for the possibility of another wave of infection. May is also a month for shoring up those safeguards. Through the cooperation of local medical associations around the country, we will further build up screening capacity, including through developing PCR centers. We will make further efforts to reduce the burden borne by, and enhance the capacity of, public health centers, the strongholds for responding to the infection in local communities. We will support the building of systems by each local government to provide appropriate care for patients smoothly depending on their symptoms, such as having them recuperate in lodging facilities or admitting them to medical facilities. We will also further strengthen domestic production and importation of medical gowns, high-performance masks, and other personal protective equipment. In addition, we will further enhance our efforts so that the government delivers such items directly to medical facilities on the front lines. We must also further strengthen the prevention of infections in nursing care facilities and other such places. Furthermore, we will accelerate in one push our efforts to establish effective therapeutic medicines and effective therapeutic methods over the next month. Japan and the United States conducted joint clinical trials of Remdesivir and it has been approved for use in the U.S. An application was filed today requesting special approval for it in Japan as well. We will move forward expeditiously with the procedures for approval. With regard to Avigan, which was developed in Japan, it has already been administered in nearly 3,000 cases and clinical trials are moving forward steadily. If its effectiveness is confirmed making use of data from these trials, we hope to grant pharmaceutical approval so that it can be used with a doctor’s prescription. We are aiming to have it approved within this month. We must use all possible means to shore up our preparations on all fronts against the next wave of infections. We consider it imperative to make this a month for doing so. Living life with various restraints on movement and with fear of infections causes tension. We have a strong sense of fear towards viruses we cannot see; I feel the same as you. At the same time, I strongly fear such feelings of unease could lead to discrimination against others or actions that reject others. It is quite possible that such reactions would have even greater negative impacts upon our society than the virus. Each and every one of us is at risk of being infected. I ask you not to hold biases against patients or their families, but instead to have the spirit of supporting each other. I am also extremely concerned about the situation in which group infections have arisen at hospitals around the country. Despite such a severe environment where the risk of infection persists, the doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, and hospital staff are doing their utmost at this very moment, with a strong sense of mission. Everything is done to save our lives. There must not be, in any way, discrimination against healthcare workers or their families. I also wish to express to them my sincere respect. There are people who work at supermarkets and drugstores, support the supply chain, or sustain our society and our daily lives in so many different places, such as the staff at nursing facilities and day care centers, even under the state of emergency. Our lives are made possible thanks to these people. I reiterate my sincere gratitude to you. We respect and appreciate those who support our daily lives, and share a feeling of mutual support towards one another. This is the spirit of compassion. With such power of bonds between people, we will most definitely overcome our feelings of fear and unease towards an invisible virus. I wish to extend my deepest appreciation once more to those spending time at home and refraining from going out for non-essential or non-urgent reasons, even during this extended holiday period this year. I feel tremendously encouraged knowing that there are people who are making an effort to enjoy time at home by deepening their bonds with others, using the Internet and social networking services to interact with friends online and through other means. Those forward-looking people are a major force pulling us through the state of emergency. Every year, many people travel as a family during Golden Week, returning to their hometowns and so on. This year we have asked people to make use of other means such as “online homecomings.” By doing so, you can protect the lives of yourself and also the family members you love. I thank you for your cooperation. The time will surely come when you head off somewhere with your family again. For the sake of that time to come, I want everyone now to please cherish, at home, the time spent with family and the conversations with other family members. According to a genome analysis released by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases the other day, Japan is believed to have succeeded in holding down the first wave of infection arriving from China by thoroughly implementing measures against clusters. The analysis also indicated that the virus that came from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where a group infection of more than 700 people emerged, was successfully contained in Japan through various measures. Furthermore, regarding the second wave, which arrived from Europe and the United States, the increase in cases is now passing its peak and we are moving towards the path of containment. You have extended tremendous cooperation. You are going through great hardship, too. There is no question that the effort and the endeavors made until now are making a difference without a doubt. If we all do our best looking towards the future, we will surely overcome the current hardships. I ask for everyone’s understanding and cooperation. Thank you very much. I will end my statement here. window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV)","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202005/_00001.html"
"13","Address by the Prime Minister for the Memorial Ceremony to Commemorate the Fallen on the 75th Anniversary of the End of the Battle of Okinawa",2020-06-23,"   As we conduct this Memorial Ceremony to Commemorate the Fallen on the 75th Anniversary of the End of the Battle of Okinawa, I wish to express my heartfelt mourning for the souls of those who perished on the battlefields as well as those who died suffering the ravages of war during the Battle of Okinawa. During World War II, Okinawa was the scene of an exceedingly fierce ground battle. Two hundred thousand precious lives were tragically lost and Okinawa’s bountiful seas and greenery, both sources of great pride, were mercilessly destroyed, with the land reduced to ashes. Among those who perished were young people full of dreams and aspirations and mothers and fathers who died wishing for the safety of their children. I am overcome with emotion as I think of the regret of all the fallen whose names are engraved on the Cornerstone of Peace. We will never forget that the peace and prosperity we now enjoy rests upon the Okinawan people’s history of suffering and hardship that is beyond description. Now, on the 75th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, I bow my head silently, reflecting solomnly once again on that fact. Since the end of the war, Japan has consistently walked the path of a nation that values peace. We will never repeat the horrors of war. I vow once more to the souls of the fallen that we will continue to be tireless in our efforts to carry out our resolute commitment and to bring about a world that is peaceful and brimming with hope. For many years, the concentration of US military bases has heavily impacted the people of Okinawa. The current situation is absolutely not permissible. In order to lessen the impact of the U.S. forces, the government is determined to deliver results one by one in a steady manner. At the site of the West Futenma Housing Area, the first large-scale site to be transferred on the basis of the plan of land returns, preparations to develop a base for health and medical care are being advanced, aiming at expanding high-level medical treatment and research functions and improving local medical care, as a precedent for the use of former base sites in the future. The construction of these facilities will begin within the current fiscal year. We will continue to make every effort to to mitigate the impact on Okinawa under the principle of “doing everything possible.” Okinawa, blessed with natural beauty and situated as a gateway to Asia, has immeasurable advantages and potential. In March this year, the long-awaited second runway at Naha Airport became open for use. I will lead the efforts to resolutely advance the development of Okinawa so that it overcomes the recent crisis caused by the novel coronavirus disease and becomes a bridge to the world as “The Bridge of Nations.” The government will also make all-out efforts, working as one, to restore Shuri Castle, which can be called the pride of the Okinawan people. I will conclude my address by praying that the souls of those who lost their lives here may rest in peace and by offering my sincere wishes for the peace of the bereaved families of the war dead. Shinzo Abe Prime Minister of Japan June 23, 2020 ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/201906/_00005.html"
"14","Press Conference by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe",2020-06-18,"  To begin my remarks, it is highly regrettable that a current member of the Diet who used to be affiliated with our party was arrested today. As the one who appointed him to be the Minister of Justice in the past, I am aware of my responsibility. I deeply apologize to the Japanese people. Taking this opportunity, I believe, we Diet members must accept profoundly the harsh gaze of the public and achieve the highest ethical standards once again. The ordinary session of the Diet, spanning 150 days, ended yesterday. Right after the Diet session convened, the novel coronavirus spread explosively in China and the city of Wuhan was locked down. We had to ensure that the Japanese nationals and their family members spending an uneasy time there in Wuhan returned to Japan safely. Everything started from the operation for that. At the end of January, we decided on measures denying entry to foreign nationals from China’s Hubei Province. In response to the subsequent global spread of the infection, the number of countries and regions subject to the entry ban has expanded to 111, and we have reinforced our border controls. In February, we responded to the situation in the Diamond Princess. Throughout March, we refrained from holding large-scale events and schools all around Japan closed temporarily. By advancing these kinds of efforts, Japan succeeded in holding down the first wave from China. However, a second wave of infections arriving from Europe and the United States spread and, with our medical facilities severely stretched, we issued a declaration of a state of emergency in April. Thanks to tremendous efforts made by the Japanese people, on May 25, we managed to lift the state of emergency nationwide. And now, we are restoring socioeconomic activities while simultaneously preventing infections. We are most certainly moving forward step by step towards a new normal for our everyday lives in the age of coronavirus. When we look back on this ordinary session of the Diet, it was truly 150 days of corona responses. During this time, we received the cooperation of not only the ruling parties but also the opposition parties, enabling us to enact expeditiously an amendment to the Act on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and Response, giving us a mean to issue a declaration of a state of emergency. Through establishing a forum for consultations between the ruling and opposition parties, we regularly exchanged views, obtaining support for the early enactment of the two consecutive supplementary budgets. Through the measures amounting to a total scale of 230 trillion yen and reaching 40 percent of our GDP, the largest scale anywhere worldwide, we will thoroughly defend employment, people’s daily lives, and the Japanese economy. I extend my wholehearted appreciation once more to all those in the ruling and opposition parties who gave us their cooperation. One hundred and fifty days ago, the features of this virus were entirely unknown to us. We have gradually come to understand its characteristics. We have learned that there is a high risk of transmitting the virus to others between one and two days prior to symptoms such as a fever or cough developing, even if a patient is asymptomatic at the time. In light of this finding, at the end of May, in addition to people for whom testing is deemed necessary by a doctor, we made all those who had close contact with infected people eligible for PCR testing, even if they show no symptoms. When the number of patients in the city of Kitakyushu increased temporarily after lifting the declaration of the state of emergency, we conducted thorough testing for those who had close contact with infected persons on the basis of this new policy. Now, the number of new cases is dropping substantially. In Tokyo, we are ramping up our testing in night entertainment districts where group infections have been confirmed to date. The number of persons confirmed positive is increasing, but we consider this reinforcement of testing to be effective in preventing a second wave of infections. Identifying only those individuals with a high risk of infections, actively conducting screening on them, and rapidly detecting positive cases -- the so-called counter-cluster (group infections) approach -- are regarded as an extremely effective measure for preventing the spread of infections in a way thoroughly compatible with socioeconomic activities. Currently, as the world is working towards the recovery of socioeconomic activities, Japan’s counter-cluster approach is receiving a great deal of attention. By avoiding the “three Cs,” closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings, we can prevent infections while continuing with our day-to-day jobs and daily lives. This too is a finding obtained in the course of advancing our counter-cluster measures, and it has become recognized as “the three Cs” the world over. From tomorrow, we will introduce the Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA), thereby strengthening by another level our counter-cluster measures. When using this app, notification is automatically sent out to people’s smartphones when they may have come into close contact with a person known to be infected. This has become a system for linking people with rapid testing. As it does not obtain personal information whatsoever, you can use this app without concern. So I very much hope that many people will download it. As I said at the previous press conference, according to a study conducted at Oxford University, if this kind of app is popularized to reach almost 60 percent of the public, leading to the early detection of people who have had close contact with infected persons, lockdowns will be avoidable. As I have said repeatedly, we must change our way of thinking. Approaches that sacrifice socioeconomic activities cannot be sustained for a long period of time. We must ensure the economy runs properly, while controlling the risk of infection through means that are the least restrictive possible. We need efforts that put greater emphasis on safeguarding our jobs and our daily lives. That is precisely why we will continue to hone the counter-cluster approach Japan takes pride in. Through the cooperation of experts, we intend to evolve those measures continuously, always incorporating the latest knowledge and most up-to-date technologies. The major premise for this is screening capacity that is more than sufficient. PCR tests using saliva have already begun. We will also advance the further use of antigen testing and strengthen our domestic screening capacity still more. Given such efforts, tomorrow, we will raise the level of socioeconomic activities another notch. People will be entirely free to travel across prefectural boundaries beginning tomorrow. We very much hope that people also go on sightseeing trips to various locations, mindful of keeping distance between themselves and others. Professional baseball will also begin tomorrow. J. League soccer is also pushing forward its preparations for matches without spectators. Concerts and other events can be held at a scale of roughly 1,000 people in attendance. We would like people to get socioeconomic activities back into full swing, with measures put in place to prevent the spread of infection through reference to the guidelines. We will certainly be on our way to create a new normal for our everyday lives. While we must of course pay careful attention, it is imperative for us to restore the flow of people between Japan and the rest of the world step by step. In a world in which globalization has progressed as much as it has, continuing the current state of our country being closed will result in tremendous impacts on our society and economy. This will in particular be fatal to Japan, an island nation that is oriented to international trade. We will reopen our country/resume our interactions in stages with necessary business exchanges for those countries in which the level of infections has been stabilized. At the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters just now, we decided on a course towards launching consultations for these purposes. The premise for this is requiring a confirmed negative result in screening done prior to departing for Japan and additionally conducting a PCR test when entering Japan. This is an approach that allows business activities by relaxing restrictions on visitors’ movement after ensuring peace of mind through sufficient layers of screenings. As countries head towards restoring the movement of people, Japan intends to lead discussions with other countries. Accordingly, it is absolutely essential that we expand our screening capacity. Through cooperation with the business community, we will consider establishing new PCR centers for people traveling overseas and other relevant measures. We intend to restore step by step and without fail our normal lives and daily routines that we lost because of this infectious disease. We must not, however, allow it to end with simply restoring what used to be. We must resolutely draw up a new shape for a Japan that has overcome this infectious disease – a new, one that we can call a “post-corona” future. While we are currently accelerating the development of therapeutic medicines and vaccines to overcome this infectious disease, another, as-yet-unknown virus could emerge tomorrow. The threat of the next global pandemic is not something of the imagination but rather a real issue. We must get to work immediately building a nation that is resilient to infectious diseases. Recently, teleworking became popularized all at once. It has now become the norm for various kinds of meetings to be held over the Internet rather than face to face. Physical distances no longer restrict us; it is possible to have an office anywhere, or live anywhere. We must not allow this new tide to flow backward; instead, we must accelerate it. At the same time, with people being strongly urged to avoid the three Cs, the richness of daily life in rural areas is once again receiving greater attention. Some surveys reveal that currently among young people in their 20s, the number of people hoping to change jobs to areas outside the major cities is increasing significantly. Away from concentration, towards dispersion. I believe that this infectious disease has provided a major trigger that fundamentally changes the shape of the Japanese archipelago or the landscape of our country. Looking ahead to the age of the coronavirus and the future beyond that, we will boldly envisage a new vision of society and a new vision of the nation. We will expand the Council on Investments for the Future and begin discussions next month with a wide variety of members participating. As we create new goals, we intend to clear away various obstacles, one by one. I believe that now is the time to build a new post-corona Japan and we must do it now. The threat of a pandemic had been pointed out in the past. And yet, we must admit that Japan was not sufficiently prepared for it. The importance of teleworking and other such changes had also been pointed out for many years, and yet no progress had been made at all. Those are the facts. “In fair weather, prepare for foul.” I believe this is the greatest lesson illustrated by the crisis posed by this infectious disease. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has already put forth, as a draft for discussion, revised text on four items aimed at amending the Constitution, including a state-of-emergency clause. I realize that various opinions exist regarding our party’s proposal as a means of preparing for a state of emergency. We intend to advance these texts while listening to the views of the various parties and party factions. The LDP welcomes constructive discussions and consultations. However, during the Diet session that just ended, unfortunately, there was again no progress at all on discussions on draft amendments within the Diet’s Commissions on the Constitution. We will bring a resolution to the issues now before us, putting them off under no circumstances. This is our responsibility as politicians. This week, we took the decision to suspend the process of deploying the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense system. Given that the premise on which our explanations to local communities were based is now different, we must not proceed any further as proposed. That is the decision we reached. Meanwhile, the security environment surrounding Japan is becoming more and more severe. There has been no change whatsoever in the current state of affairs. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now becoming increasingly strained. We will secure the lives and peaceful daily lives of the Japanese people from the threat of ballistic missiles. That is the most important responsibility of the government. We must never allow a gap to arise in our nation’s defenses. Peace is not something granted to us by others; it is something we earn through our own efforts. The basis of security policy is none other than Japan’s own efforts. What should we do to reinforce our deterrence or our capacity to deal with security matters? What should we do in order to defend Japan to the end? This summer, we intend to thoroughly discuss at the National Security Council our national security strategy, hammer out a new direction, and implement it expeditiously. I will end my opening statement here.     window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202006/_00001.html"
"15","Message from the Prime Minister on the Occasion of Marine Day 2020",2020-07-17," Hello, everyone. I am Prime Minister ABE Shinzo. I am truly pleased to commemorate Marine Day 2020. For Japan, a country that relies on overseas nations for a great deal of our energy and other resources, maritime trade is essential. Furthermore, in Japan, where we enjoy abundant fishery resources, we derive many kinds of blessings from the sea. Our daily lives are made possible thanks to those doing their very best in their workplaces, including in marine transport and fisheries, even in the midst of the novel coronavirus disease. Japan is surrounded by the sea and enjoys one of the world’s leading vast maritime jurisdictions. In order to protect the sea, cooperation with other countries is also critical. We will engage in comprehensive maritime security, which ensures free, open, and safe seas. Above the sea the winds blow powerfully, while at the ocean floor, minerals and other resources are found in abundance. We intend to further draw out the sea’s potential by providing support for the development of revolutionary technologies and innovations and advancing the creation of new industries including offshore wind power. Protecting our bountiful seas and handing them down to future generations is a major responsibility of our generation that lives today. As for marine plastic litter, an issue becoming increasingly severe, we will expand measures to be taken by the entire world under the “Osaka BlueOceanVision,” which aims to reduce additional pollution bymarine plastic littertozeroby 2050. As one of the world’s leading maritime nations, Japan is determined to demonstrate leadership towards resolving this critical global issue. I wish to end this message for Marine Day 2020 by expressing once again my appreciation for the benefits we receive from the sea and a wish for the maritime nation of Japan as well as the world to enjoy ever-greater peace and prosperity. Thank you very much. Abe Shinzo Prime Minister Director-General of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy July 17, 2020 ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202007/_00001.html"
"16","Press Conference by the Prime Minister",2020-08-28,"  I wish to thank the Japanese people sincerely for taking thorough measures to counter both the coronavirus and heatstroke as the intense heat continues, and for cooperating with various requests from the national and local governments. With regard to coronavirus countermeasures, while we have been in a tough fight against a faceless enemy since this January, we have made our best efforts given the knowledge we had at the time to reduce the number of infections as much as possible, prevent patients from developing severe symptoms to the greatest possible extent, and protect people’s lives. Despite those efforts, unfortunately, a large number of people have lost their lives to the novel coronavirus. I extend my heartfelt condolences to those who have passed away. I also express my thanks once again to the healthcare professionals who are giving their all providing medical care for patients even at this very moment. Today we decided on future coronavirus countermeasures that anticipate the shift from summer into autumn and the arrival of winter. Over the last six months, we have come to understand many things. By taking preventive measures, such as diligently avoiding the three Cs, it is fully possible to successfully fight the coronavirus while engaging in socioeconomic activities. Treatment methods appropriate for particular symptoms have been developed, such as Remdesivir, and now the case fatality rate for younger generations in their 40s or younger is less than 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, more than half of all those who have died are of the generation in their 80s or older. People with a high risk of developing severe symptoms are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Countermeasures targeting these people will be the biggest key in protecting as many lives as possible. As we head towards winter, it is anticipated that in addition to coronavirus, the spread of influenza and other diseases could increase the number of people developing fevers. In order to reduce the burden on medical care services, it is necessary for us to transition to countermeasures from now that put more emphasis on patients having a high risk of developing severe symptoms. First will be drastically expanding our testing capacity. We will aim at a screening capacity of 200,000 tests per day, enabling us to test simultaneously for influenza by winter. At elderly care facilities and hospitals in particular, where there are people at high risk of developing severe symptoms, taking into account the local infection situation, we will implement regular screening all at once for the staff of those facilities. By doing so, we will prevent group infections among the elderly and those with underlying conditions. We also intend to prioritize medical assistance to the elderly and others with a high risk of developing severe cases. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is, under the Infectious Diseases Control Law, currently considered equivalent to a Class II Infectious Disease, examples of which include tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or higher. Based on our knowledge gained thus far, moving forward, we will review the application of the current arrangement, including amending the relevant government ordinances. We will thoroughly ensure that mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic people will receive treatment at accommodation facilities or at their own houses, reducing the burden imposed on public health centers and medical institutions. Medical institutions, university-affiliated hospitals, and other facilities accepting coronavirus patients are facing a considerable drop in revenues. Despite the fact that they are making every possible effort around the clock for the sake of the public, they are experiencing great financial hardship. We will provide all possible assistance to dispel their worries over running their hospitals. Even during the influenza season, we will certainly ensure that a sufficient medical treatment structure is in place. We will utilize contingency funds successively for these measures and implement them immediately. Along with our efforts to counter the coronavirus, our response to the severe security environment surrounding Japan does not permit any temporary vacuum. North Korea is making major improvements to its ballistic missile capabilities. In response to this, are we really able to protect and defend the lives and the peaceful daily lives of the Japanese people only by improving our interception capability? At a meeting of the National Security Council two days ago, we discussed a new course for security policy regarding countering missiles, given the current severe security environment. From now we will swiftly enter into coordination with the ruling parties and work on its materialization. Having now reported to the people about those two issues, I would like to talk about the concern over my personal health. Thirteen years ago, my chronic ulcerative colitis took a turn for the worse. In just one year, I suddenly resigned from the post of prime minister, causing great inconvenience among the public. Later, fortunately, a new drug was very effective, and I returned to great shape physically. I again took up the weighty responsibility of serving as prime minister thanks to support from the people. Over the last almost eight years I have kept my chronic illness fully under control and have had no trouble devoting all of my energy every day, day after day, to the job of prime minister. However, I was told during a regular checkup in June that symptoms of a relapse could be seen. Since that time I have continued to devote all my energies to my duties while taking medicine, but from roughly the middle of July something unusual happened to me health-wise, and I began to get quite physically exhausted. Then, at the beginning of August a relapse of my ulcerative colitis was confirmed. As for my treatment from now, a new drug has been added to the medication I have been taking until now. At the re-examination I underwent at the beginning of this week, this new drug was confirmed to be effective. But it is necessary to have this medicine administered continuously for a while and it is difficult to foresee the result. In politics, the most important thing is to deliver results. I have been saying this ever since my administration was inaugurated, and over these seven years and eight months I have dedicated myself completely to achieving results. It would be unacceptable if I were to err in an important political decision or fail to achieve results because of the pain of not being at peak physical condition while being sick and undergoing treatment. I have made the determination that, as I have become unable to confidently live up to the mandate from the people, I should not continue in the position of prime minister. I will resign my position as prime minister. We must avoid to the greatest possible extent a situation in which our response to the coronavirus, the most important issue right now, encounters obstacles. For the past roughly one month, this has been my entire focus. I worried about this terribly. For now, the spread of infection that we had seen from July has shifted into a declining trend and we succeeded in compiling countermeasures to be implemented with our eyes fixed firmly on the winter. I decided that if we are to transition to a new administration, this is the only timing possible. I have taken on a wide range of challenges over these seven years and eight months. Regrettably, there are also many issues that remain. At the same time, there are things that I achieved or made a reality in the course of taking on various challenges. All of this is thanks to the people, who placed strong confidence in us and encouraged us during each national election. I thank you sincerely. Despite such support, I am to resign with another year in my term of office—a year still left to go— leaving various other policies still on the way to being realized and the coronavirus epidemic at hand. I express my heartfelt apologies to the people for this situation. It is a matter of the greatest regret that I was unable to resolve the abductions issue by my own hand. It is with the utmost reluctance that I leave my position without having achieved the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia as well as amendments to the Constitution. However, all of these are policies that the LDP has pledged to the people, and I am certain that under a new and vigorous administration they will gain greater momentum for their advancement and move towards becoming realized. Of course, until the next prime minister is appointed, I will thoroughly fulfill my responsibilities until the very end. And, I intend to manage to recover my physical health fully through my treatment and support the new administration as a member of the Diet. I thank the Japanese people sincerely for these eight years.     window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=""/info:ndljp/pid/11547454/nettv.gov-online.go.jp/common/js/jquery.js""><\/script>')If you can not view the video,click here(Japanese Government Internet TV) ","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202008/_00004.html"
"17","Address by the Prime Minister at the Seventy-Fifth National Memorial Ceremony for the War Dead",2020-08-15,"  In the gracious presence of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress, and with the attendance of bereaved families of the war dead and distinguished representatives of all sectors of society, I hereby commence the annual National Memorial Ceremony for the War Dead. More than three million of our compatriots lost their lives during the war, which was extremely fierce and harsh. Some fell on the battlefields worrying about the future of their homeland and wishing for the happiness of their families. Others perished in remote foreign countries after the war. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the air raids on Tokyo and other cities, and the ground battles in Okinawa, among others, took a heavy toll without mercy. Here, before the souls of all who lost their lives, I offer my heartfelt prayers for their repose. Again now on the 75th anniversary of the end of the war, we will never forget that the peace and prosperity we enjoy today was built atop the precious sacrifices of the war dead. I express my deepest respect and gratitude once more. Never will we forget the large number of war dead whose remains have still not been recovered. Taking it as the responsibility of the nation, we shall spare no effort to enable their remains to return to their hometowns at the earliest possible time. Over the 75 years since the end of the war, Japan has consistently walked the path of a country that values peace. We have worked to the very best of our ability to transform the world into a better place. We must never again repeat the devastation of war. We will continue to remain committed to this resolute pledge. Under the banner of ""Proactive Contribution to Peace,"" we are determined to join hands with the international community and play a greater role than ever before in resolving the various challenges facing the world. We shall overcome the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and carve out the future of our nation for the sake of the generation alive now and the generations of tomorrow. I will conclude my address by once again offering my heartfelt prayers for the repose of the souls of the war dead and for the happiness of the members of their bereaved families.

"18","Address by the Prime Minister at the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony",2020-08-09," Today, at the opening of the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing, I reverently express my sincere condolences to the souls of the great number of atomic bomb victims.  I also extend my heartfelt sympathy to those still suffering even now from the aftereffects of the atomic bomb.  This year, as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) grips the world, people all around the globe continue to make resolute efforts at this very moment to overcome this trial.  Seventy-five years ago today, Nagasaki was reduced to ashes, with not a single tree or blade of grass remaining. Yet through the efforts of its citizens, it achieved reconstruction beautifully as we see today. Mindful of this, we again feel strongly that there is no trial that cannot be overcome and feel acutely how precious peace is.   The devastation that took place in Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the human suffering that resulted must never be repeated. As the only country to have experienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war, Japan has the unceasing mission of advancing steadily, step by step, the efforts of the international community towards realizing “a world free of nuclear weapons.”  In the midst of the severe security environment and the disparity in countries’ standpoints on nuclear disarmament that we see today, it is imperative that countries eradicate distrust through mutual engagement and dialogue and make efforts over time to forge a common foundation.  In particular, this year is the milestone of the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombings. While firmly upholding the “Three Non-Nuclear Principles,” Japan will lead the international community’s efforts to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons by serving as a mediator bridging the gap between countries with different standpoints and by tenaciously promoting dialogue and actions by various countries.  This year is the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In order for the Treaty to continue to play a role in supporting the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, it is essential to make the upcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty, one that produces a meaningful outcome. Japan will urge all countries to carry on with their united efforts and, utilizing the outcomes of the discussions of the Group of Eminent Persons for Substantive Advancement of Nuclear Disarmament, continue to make active contributions.  What supports determined steps towards realizing “a world free of nuclear weapons” are efforts to communicate and pass down to future generations and beyond borders the devastation and inhumanity of using nuclear weapons. Japan will work in tandem with atomic bomb survivors in its ongoing efforts to promote understanding of the tragic realities of the atomic bombings.  The Government, accepting the necessity of relief measures covering health and medical services and welfare of atomic bomb survivors, will continue to advance relief measures in a comprehensive manner while staying in tune with atomic bomb survivors, who are advancing in years, including by conducting screenings for recognizing atomic bomb diseases as quickly as possible.  In closing, here in Nagasaki, where prayers for eternal peace are offered continuously, I pledge that Japan will make its utmost efforts for the realization of a world free of nuclear weapons and eternal peace. I wish to conclude with my heartfelt prayers for the repose of the souls of those who fell victim to the atomic bombing here in Nagasaki. I also pray sincerely for the inner peace of the bereaved families and the atomic bomb survivors as well as all the participants today and the people of Nagasaki City.

"19","Address by the Prime Minister at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony",2020-08-06," Today, at the opening of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing, I reverently express my sincere condolences to the souls of the great number of atomic bomb victims.  I also extend my heartfelt sympathy to those still suffering even now from the aftereffects of the atomic bomb.  This year, as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) grips the world, people all around the globe continue to make resolute efforts at this very moment to overcome this trial.   Despite having been turned to ruins 75 years ago through the dropping of a single atomic bomb, this beautiful city admirably achieved reconstruction through the efforts of our forebears. Standing before it, I renew my determination to overcome the trial we now face and once more turn my thoughts to how precious peace is.

"20","Statement by Prime Minister",2020-09-11,"For the last seven years and eight months since I assumed the office of Prime Minister, Japan’s security policy has made significant progress. The Legislation for Peace and Security was passed, which has made the Japan-U.S. Alliance more robust. We have been striving to make the environment surrounding Japan more secure by enhancing Japan’s own defense capability, strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and establishing cooperative relations with other countries, based on the vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”Japan’s security environment is becoming more testing. In particular, North Korea retains hundreds of ballistic missiles with a range that covers Japan. North Korea is assessed to have already successfully miniaturized nuclear weapons, and to possess the capability to launch an attack on Japan with ballistic missiles fitted with nuclear warheads. It is also pointed out that new types of short-range ballistic missiles launched last year were developed in an attempt to breach missile defense networks. There is also a concern that such advanced technology would be applied to longer-range missiles.Under such severe circumstances, what should we do to protect and defend the lives and the peaceful livelihoods of the Japanese people? The Government of Japan must do what it should. First, as to the suspension of the process of deploying Aegis Ashore, the Government has examined how it was decided, and already released the results. Further, the Government has been examining possible alternatives to Aegis Ashore, so as to ensure that Japan has an interception capability to defend itself from threats of ballistic missiles and others.Nevertheless, there is a question of whether it is possible to protect and defend the lives and the peaceful livelihoods of the Japanese people only by enhancing our interception capability. Under such thinking and in order to strengthen the deterrence, the Government of Japan has been considering a new course for security policy regarding countering missiles. Needless to say, such deliberation is being carried out within the scope of the Constitution and in compliance with international law, and Japan’s exclusively defense-oriented policy will not change at all. Nor will the basic role and mission sharing between Japan and the United States. The bond of the alliance will be strengthened if each side can assist each other. As such, I believe it is necessary to enhance deterrence and thereby further reduce the possibility of an attack against Japan by ballistic missiles and others.On these points, in thorough consultations with the ruling parties, the Government of Japan will identify policies to be undertaken by the end of this year to respond to the severe security environment surrounding Japan.The most consequential responsibility of the Government of Japan is to maintain Japan’s peace and security, to ensure its survival and to defend to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property of its nationals and territorial land, waters and airspace. This is the foremost responsibility that Japan must fulfill as a sovereign nation. Japan’s defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of its security and the clear representation of the unwavering will and ability of Japan as a peace-loving nation. The Government of Japan must continue working to maintain Japan’s peace and security, which is an essential premise for its prosperity.","https://warp.ndl.go.jp//info:ndljp/pid/11547454/japan.kantei.go.jp/98_abe/statement/202009/_00002.html"
