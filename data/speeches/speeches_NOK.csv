"1"," Joint Statement on the Role of a Sustainable Ocean Economy in a post-COVID-19 World ",2020-06-08,"Blue nature is central to the planet and its people. The ocean covers over 70 percent of the earth’s surface, absorbs about a quarter of all carbon emissions, and captures more than 90 percent of the additional heat they generate. A fundamental building block of the global economy, it contributes over $2.5 trillion annually in value-added services, feeds over three billion people, provides a livelihood for over three billion people, and transports around 90 percent of world trade. It is also a source of renewable energy and key ingredients for fighting disease. And it can do more if we sustainably manage it. World leaders must value the ocean in recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In a sustainable ocean economy, effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity go hand-in-hand. Investing in a sustainable ocean economy is an excellent deal: it has considerable benefits for the global economy, the ocean and societal well-being. The High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy is committed to the transition to a sustainable ocean economy, which is essential for jobs, food security, healthy people and ecosystems, a low-carbon world, equity, and resilience. Our nations are currently working on a set of recommendations to enable this transition, which is also vital for a sustainable relationship between people and planet—the entire blue planet. We cannot let this opportunity escape us. We, the members of the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, lead nations of highly diverse oceanic, economic and political perspectives. Driven by a commitment to partnership, shared knowledge and science-informed policy, we aim to advance the values underpinning a sustainable ocean economy—effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/joint-statement-on-the-role-of-a-sustainable-ocean-economy-in-a-post-covid-19-world/id2706086/"
"2"," High-Level Event on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond ",2020-05-28,"Excellencies, Dear Colleagues. Thank you for this important initiative. The human costs and the economic effects of this pandemic are staggering. With unemployment soaring, investments and remittances falling, and debt mounting, those with the least are – as always – hit the hardest. Disruptions in supply-chains add to the strain by creating shortages of essential goods such as food, fertilizers, medicines and fuel. These problems call for urgent global action and solidarity.  Let me highlight three priority initiatives for Norway. Firstly, development and fair global distribution of vaccines, including to low and middle-income countries. The Norwegian initiated Coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, CEPI, is central to achieving this. I am encouraged by the strong international support for CEPIs efforts. We have also increased our funding to GAVI, to WHO, and to the UN humanitarian response.  Secondly, we invest in a united global response with a strong UN at its core. Therefore, Norway took the initiative to establish a UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. The aim is to help those most vulnerable to economic hardship. We also support the International Financial Institutions debt moratorium and deferment of payments. Thirdly, corruption and fraud thrive in times of chaos. We are therefore strongly committed to ending illicit financial flows. Norway, as current ECOSOC President, was proud to establish a high-level panel on financial accountability, transparency and integrity, the FACTI panel, together with the President of the General Assembly. Financing for development is at the core of our ECOSOC Presidency. ECOSOC recently facilitated the first universal agreement to finance COVID-19 response. Furthermore, the ECOSOC Financing for Development Forum will meet on June 2. to focus on the need for stronger financing assistance. In this regard, we must also work to ensure rapid disbursements of funds to those in need. This is crucial to halting the economic downturn in many countries Our recovery from the pandemic and the economic downturn will be quicker if we recommit to a spirit of cooperation and are guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. This is not the time to seek confrontation and look inward. Instead, let us use this moment to ensure more global cooperation, in order to build back a healthier, greener, fairer, gender equal and sustainable world. Thank you.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/high-level-event-on-financing-for-development-in-the-era-of-covid-19-and-beyond-convened-by-canada/id2704279/"
"3"," Special Session of the UN General Assembly in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic ",2020-12-03,"I am here today with two messages: First; we must handle the ongoing crises and stop the pandemic as soon as we can. We are facing perhaps the darkest hours of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of deaths has surpassed 1.3 million people. Millions of children have to stay away from their schools. There are new lockdowns. The global economy is faced with a loss of more than 500 billion US Dollars a month. Unemployment, human suffering, despairing health workers and the collapse of social systems are happening everywhere. BUT. There are rays of light. News of efficient vaccines give us hope. The commitment of countries, civil society and industry to find effective tools is encouraging. However. To actually end the pandemic for all, this is the time to increase our efforts. We need more vaccines, we need diagnostics and therapeutics. And we need to secure fair and global access through efficient distribution on the ground. To reach the most vulnerable groups, also the health connector should be strengthened. We need increased support for universal health care to deliver efficient health services – including COVID-19 tools such as vaccines. The ACT Accelerator was set up to do just that. Norway is proud to co-chair the ACT Accelator, and we are deeply committed to do our share. We plan to allocate another 223 million US Dollars in 2020, totaling our contribution for global efforts so far to more than 500 million dollars. More countries need to come forward to contribute their share. Today´s event is important for two reasons: We must reach a shared understanding of the realities we are facing. And we must recognize the possibility of ending the pandemic if we work together. Our commitment to international cooperation has been our strength and strategy in fighting the pandemic. There are no other alternatives but to continue this cooperation. My second message is that we must prevent future disasters No matter how soon we manage to end COVID-19, we need to equip ourselves with better tools to prevent and efficiently respond to future pandemics and global disasters. Leaders and stakeholders must develop a master plan together, where responsibilities and future work is clearly outlined and recognized. This must be based on existing and enhanced global commitments to prevent such disasters. In other words, we must strengthen our joint defence. I support the Secretary General and the call for a Global Summit to address this. We must invest in the future by making all societies more robust. We must build back better in order to secure truly sustainable development, including happier & healthier lives for all. Thank you.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/un-general-assembly-special-session-on-the-covid-19-pandemic/id2789553/"
"4"," 2020 UNESCO Global Education meeting ",2020-10-22,"Dear friends, We all know that education is the most powerful investment we can make in our future. Now, COVID-19 is putting our commitment to the test. In Norway, as in countries all over the world, we are experiencing how devastating the pandemic is for people’s health, our economies and societies. We must combat the pandemic in order for society and schools to return to normal. But more than returning to normal, education holds the key to unlocking sustainable development and building back better. We know that education reduces poverty and exploitation. We know that education increases productivity and leads to higher earnings. We know that a child whose mother can read is far more likely to live a healthy life. Malala told us that “One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world”. To me this means that education is the key to freedom and progress for all, including for girls all over the world. During the pandemic 1.6 billion students have been directly affected by lock-downs and closed schools. School closures have stripped many children of the opportunity to learn, a safe space and even healthy meals. For girls, the probability of early marriage and early pregnancies have increased. It is likely that many learners will never return to school. I fear that the pandemic will cause permanent setbacks for education and gender equality. This would lead to permanent loss in learning and trillions lost in earnings. We can therefore safely say that financing of education should not be regarded as an expenditure, but as the best investment societies can make. Two elements are important for rapid recovery: financing and political commitment.  To achieve the education SDG, countries must invest a higher share of national resources in education. In many cases, the right to education will remain an empty promise unless education spending increases. We need to mobilize more international financing for global education. And, we need to assure that all investments are used effectively. The times ahead will be a test of our ability to deliver on political commitments and cooperation. It will also be a time of opportunity: Opportunity to address the learning crisis. Opportunity to test new innovative tools. Opportunity to strengthen synergies between health and education to ensure that even the most marginalized children survive and thrive. We need effective cooperation at the global and national levels, to seize the opportunities. I support the Global Education Meetings’ declaration and its clear propositions to fast track progress on SDG 4. All children, and, I should stress, all girls, must return to school. This is vital for rebuilding economies and societies, and for the freedom of our children. This is our responsibility. Thank you","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/unesco-global-education-meeting/id2774184/"
"5"," PM Solbergs statement at the Global Vaccine Summit 2020 ",2020-06-04,"We know from our own experience that investing in vaccines is one of the best public health investments we can make. Norway was one of the founders of Gavi 20 years ago. We believed, and still believe, in the vision and mission to improve the world, one vaccine at a time. Now, 20 years on, more than 760 million children have been given a better chance to reach adulthood, and to become productive members of society. Preventing future epidemics of diseases such as measles and polio, through Gavi’s strategic and innovative approach to make vaccines affordable and accessible, has saved millions of lives. In line with the strong “Gavi tradition”, we must continue to make sure no-one is left behind. Today’s pandemic and the ongoing unprecedented efforts to find vaccines against COVID-19 is a testament to the significance of vaccines. World leaders must deliver on our promise to ensure that a vaccine, once developed, is available globally to those most in need first, including to those countries that do not have the ability to pay. It is a human rights issue. It is a global health security issue. The New Advanced Mechanism Commitment for COVID-19 vaccines will ensure that also people in low-and lower-middle income countries have access to vaccines, once developed. This is a highly appreciated and timely initiative. Norway is looking with interest into proposals for global solutions with broad participation to secure the efficient procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to all, for example the Covax Facility presented by Gavi and CEPI. Norway will continue to be a committed long-term partner for Gavi. I am pleased to announce Norway’s contribution of 1 billion USD, including 400 mill. USD to IFFIm for the strategic period 2021 - 2025. Furthermore, 5,6 million USD already committed to Gavi will be used as seed-money to the new Advanced Mechanism Commitment.  Thank you","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/pm-solbergs-statement-at-global-vaccine-summit/id2705050/"
"6"," Ocean action offers ‘blue boost’ for recovery ",2020-08-12,"The numbers back this up: new research commissioned by the Ocean Panel shows that every dollar invested in key ocean actions — like increasing sustainable seafood production from fisheries and aquaculture, decarbonising international shipping, scaling up offshore wind power and conserving and restoring mangroves — yields $5 in return, often more. A blue boost to our global recovery efforts will benefit all oceanic nations regardless of size or wealth and can make a substantial contribution to meeting carbon-reduction targets. A sustainable ocean economy brings health and social benefits, as well as economic and environmental ones. It means enhanced food security and better diets, improved air quality, greater resilience in the face of storm surges and natural disasters, and the development of more sustainable jobs in tourism and fisheries. Our own countries, Palau and Norway, have long looked to the ocean for our prosperity. Now, in the face of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, we encourage others to see the ocean as a solution to many challenges facing humanity rather than simply a victim of human activity.

"7"," PM Solbergs statement at Coronavirus Global Response Summit ",2020-05-04,"Thank you, Ursula. Good afternoon, everyone. This conference is an expression of one key fact: That a global health crisis can only be pushed back through solidarity, and true partnership between governments, strong multilateral institutions, civil society and the private sector. As long as the virus is active somewhere, we are at risk everywhere.: to protect ourselves, we must protect each other.  Today marks a turning-point in how we combat the pandemic. This is the beginning of a global movement barely seen before. Through the partnerships launched today, we will intensify the search for a vaccine. We will strengthen the search for effective treatment and increase our diagnostic capacities. And we will make sure that the achievements are fairly distributed and universally available. These partnerships must also be with us when we recover. We should be guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, including the commitment to leave no-one behind. Norway supports the leadership of WHO. Without WHO, an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic will not be possible. Multilateral cooperation is more important than ever. We pledge an additional 50 million kroner to the WHO. Further, we commit to support global Covid-19 efforts directed to the poorest and most vulnerable. We will develop and detail our response in the coming weeks and months Norway funds the development of a vaccine through CEPI and will increase our support with 220 million US Dollars – and we do so together with other committed states and actors. But as we all know, developing the tools only gets us half way. In order to save lives, vaccines, treatment and diagnostic tools must be made available to all GAVI plays a vital role in making vaccines, including a COVID-19 vaccine when ready, available to poor countries and vulnerable groups. Norway pledges 1 billion US Dollars to Gavi for the next strategic period, including 400 mill USD to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm). As co-leader of today’s event, I will work to mobilise resources and political commitment. For fair access and distribution of vaccines. Together we will reach our goals of a safer and more sustainable future for all. Thank you.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/pm-solbergs-statement-at-coronavirus-global-response-summit/id2701044/"
"8"," Climate Ambition Summit ",2020-12-12,"Five years ago, we agreed on the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals. Best available science tells us: To reach the temperature target, deep cuts in global emissions are needed, fast. Norway submitted its enhanced NDC in February. As one of the first countries. We will cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030, aiming towards 55% below 1990 levels. We seek to cooperate with the EU to accomplish this. We are in process of strengthening our domestic policies to reduce emissions. They will continue to build on general carbon pricing as one of our most important measures. This will give a strong and predictable signal to reduce emissions across sectors. More than 80 per cent of Norway's emissions are covered by the European emissions trading system or subject to carbon taxes.  We recently submitted our Low Emission Strategy. Our goal is to become a low emission society by 2050. The strategy sets out our path to get there. Norway is proud to lead on climate action. But enhanced NDCs are required from all, especially big emitters. Through strengthened ambition, cooperation and support we can deliver the goals of the Paris agreement together.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/climate-ambitions-summit/id2791361/"
"9"," Stronger Nordic cooperation in a stronger UN ",2020-09-20,"The growing polarisation within and between countries is deeply worrying. It is becoming increasingly clear that progressive countries must step forward and take greater responsibility for protecting the multilateral system. The Nordic countries are seeking to work together more closely within the UN and we are committed to shouldering our responsibility with the EU and other like-minded stakeholders around the world. Seventy-five years ago, in the wake of two devastating world wars, the nations of the world agreed to cooperate and resolve conflicts within a rules-based global order. The UN has gradually developed into an organisation that addresses a wide range of global issues, including poverty reduction, sustainable development, human rights, equality, trade, climate change and the environment – based on a common belief that the major challenges of our time can only be dealt with through international cooperation. While there are many positive achievements to look back on over the last 75 years, we would like to take this opportunity to look to the future. The Nordic countries want to see a stronger UN and we stand together in supporting international cooperation. During the UN high-level meeting tomorrow, all 193 Member States will adopt a joint declaration. The declaration promotes a more agile, accountable and effective United Nations. The Nordic countries fully support the declaration and we will further strengthen our engagement to ensure its implementation in the following areas: A stronger and reformed UNThe UN needs to be better equipped to hold countries that violate international law accountable. The UN has shown leadership in the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the crisis has highlighted the need for a stronger multilateral system that will be better able to meet the needs of tomorrow. We support Secretary-General Guterres’ ambitions to make the UN more efficient. Our collective security depends upon all countries doing their part to safeguard the rules-based world order and participating proactively in multilateral cooperation. Support to the UN to address the ongoing pandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that we must take care of each other if we are to get through this. We have a joint responsibility to strengthen global health systems, contribute to global health security and promote healthier societies. We fully support the efforts of the UN, the WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to ensure fair global access to a COVID-19 vaccine. Universal values of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and gender equality form the heart of Nordic thinking, and these should be an integral part of the effort to fight COVID-19 and realise the 2030 Agenda. A sustainable recoveryThe global recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic must be used to build back better, stronger and greener. We strongly support better implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. We are determined to work for a green and sustainable transition in our own Nordic region and globally, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries. We need to equip the population with the right skills to meet the demands of a new labour market. A fair and inclusive recoveryEfforts to promote a more gender-equal and equitable world must also be intensified. The UN needs more measures to counter systematic inequalities that divide our societies. The approach to sustainable socio-economic recovery must be guided by fairness and inclusiveness, leaving no one behind. We are stepping up our work to safeguard human rights, including women’s rights, not least with regard to sexual and reproductive health. Promoting the economic empowerment of women must be at the core of the strategy to restart economic growth and job creation. Strengthening common securityThe UN has played a central role in enhancing our common security through activities such as preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping operations over the past 75 years. With Norway on the Security Council in 2021–2022, the Nordic countries can once again help promote a more effective and transparent Security Council. The Nordic countries share a long tradition of conflict resolution and conflict prevention. We will continue to push for implementation of the agenda for women, peace and security, which was adopted 20 years ago. In light of our strong focus on humanitarian action, we will also continue our efforts to ensure that those in distress receive the urgent help they need. Seventy-five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and 50 years after the entry into force of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the importance of nuclear disarmament to our common security remains as relevant as ever. The global arms control architecture is under pressure, with countries in breach of previous agreements and expanding their nuclear arsenals. Solutions must be based on multilateral cooperation, with the NPT as the cornerstone for efforts on nuclear disarmament.  The current pandemic has made it obvious that greater cooperation is called for. We have the chance to choose a path that capitalises on the current opportunities to rebuild our societies to provide a gender-equal, equitable, peaceful, climate-friendly and sustainable future for coming generations. This is the path the Nordic countries wish to pursue. Strengthening the UN and international cooperation is crucial for our collective security and safety, our prosperity and our common interests. Current and future generations should expect nothing less.  Let us reaffirm our commitment to the core values on which the UN was founded and help build a safer and better future for the generations to come, one that brings prosperity for all. We are stronger together.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/stronger-nordic-cooperation-in-a-stronger-un/id2765678/"
"10"," Norway's statement at the United Nations General Assembly ",2020-09-26,"Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, The United Nations was founded on hope – the hope for a better tomorrow in the aftermath of war. As we meet today, 75 years later, COVID-19 is putting us all to the test: Will we tackle the largest global challenge since the UN was established? Building on the lessons from other crises and infectious diseases, Norway continues our unwavering commitment to the UN and multilateral solutions. In response to the pandemic, we took the initiative to establish a UN COVID-19 response and recovery fund, and we are co-chairing the global effort on access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines – the ACT Accelerator. We stand firm in our conviction that global problems need global solutions.   President, The goal of the UN is a world of peace and security. A world ruled by justice and respect for human rights. A world that acts decisively to reduce inequality, poverty and hunger. Acts to stem climate change. And acts to build resilience against pandemics and other global threats. We celebrate 75 years of the United Nations. In the next seventy-five years, how many new conflicts will emerge? How many new refugees will flee from destruction and persecution? How many girls will attend school? How many children will be vaccinated? Whatever old challenges remain and new challenges arise in the next 75 years, the UN must be at the center of our coordinated efforts. This is why we continue to invest both financially and politically in this organization. I would like to pay tribute to the many deeply committed women and men who represent the United Nations across the globe. Civilian as well as uniformed. You deserve our gratitude and respect.   President, In June, Norway was elected as one of five incoming members of the UN Security Council. We are grateful for the strong vote of confidence from the member states. We are preparing for this assignment fully aware that it is one of the most important and demanding tasks in international politics. Throughout our campaign, we strengthened bilateral bonds with all UN member states. We pledged to listen and engage. To be open for dialogue with all countries. We will honor that commitment. In addressing country situations on the Security Council’s agenda, Norway will focus on four thematic areas in particular. First, we will use our experience from peace diplomacy to help fulfil the UN’s untapped potential to prevent and resolve conflicts and sustain peace. Second, we will build on the women, peace and security agenda and promote women’s participation in peace processes. Only an inclusive process can lead to sustainable peace for all. Third, Norway will focus on the protection of civilians, including children, based on international humanitarian and human rights law. We will give special priority to preventing and combating sexual violence in conflict. Fourth, Norway will bring climate-related security threats into the discussion. We must acknowledge that people living in conflict zones are among the most vulnerable to climate change, and that climate change in turn increases the risk of conflict. The Security Council has a primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. The Council should investigate any dispute or situation that might lead to international friction. And the Council should apply appropriate measures to stop aggression or prevent escalation of conflict. This is at the heart of the Security Council, and at the heart of the UN. Because there can be no development without peace.   President, Human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles are the building blocks of just, peaceful and prosperous societies. Societies where citizens are protected and leaders are held accountable. Today, we are witnessing a different trend towards more authoritarianism and populism. Civil society, human rights defenders and media workers are increasingly coming under attack. The basic human rights of women are being undermined. Minorities are being targeted and vilified. The pandemic is amplifying this negative trend. We have seen examples of the pandemic being used as a pretext to weaken democratic principles and human rights. The pandemic is an exam in practical governance for all states. The report card will be open for the world to see. We must ensure that human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and gender equality are at the core of our response and recovery efforts. Only then can we hope not only to soften the fall, but to build back better.   President, I am shocked and saddened by the increase in violence against women and girls as a result of ongoing lockdowns across the world. Women are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many societies. Women are on the front line as health care workers. At the same time, women’s own access to health care is heavily affected. Denying women access to sexual and reproductive health services can lead to more maternal deaths, more teenage pregnancies and more child marriages. We must ensure that women and girls are protected. That they have access to health care. And that women have access to financial incentives for response and recovery. Norway has a long tradition of promoting women's rights and gender equality.  We know from our own experience that it is not just the right thing to do – it is the smart thing to do. Gender equality is well worth the investments. If we are to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, gender equality must be integrated in all our efforts. We must invest in girls and women. In their education, in their health, and in their participation in the labour market. Increasing their opportunities and leveling the playing field pays great economic dividends.   President, Eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our plan of action for people, for the planet and for prosperity. There is a danger that this pandemic may reverse years of progress on the SDGs. It has laid bare the weaknesses in our common systems. Extreme poverty is increasing, jobs are being lost at an unprecedented scale, and children are being deprived of their education. We have no alternative but to take decisive action now, and redouble our efforts to reach the sustainable development goals.  In our continued quest to achieve these goals, national ownership and resource mobilization is crucial. Progress requires financing. We acknowledged this in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development. Funding sustainable development is more critical now than ever. The pandemic has exposed and compounded structural inequalities in all countries. Our response must focus on helping those furthest behind.  The Addis Agenda highlights the importance of domestic resource mobilization in order to provide basic public goods and services. Yet public goods and services, such as health care and education, remain underfunded. We need to stop the drain on public resources. We must prevent corruption, tax evasion and other financial crime. To this end, Norway in its capacity as ECOSOC President launched a High-Level Panel on Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity – the FACTI panel – together with the President of the 74th General Assembly. The Panel will review current challenges and offer recommendations related to illicit financial flows. It is a common responsibility of all member states to make sure there are no safe havens for the proceeds of crime, corruption or tax evasion.    President, We need a healthy planet to fulfill the SDGs. Many member states are facing climate related disasters – more frequent and more dangerous than ever before. The most vulnerable among us are hardest hit. The threat to small island states is existential. The people in the Sahel are among the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Yet they are among the world’s lowest emitters of CO2.  It is our common obligation to invest in resilience, especially in the parts of the world most adversely affected by climate change. 2020 remains the crucial year for countries to update and strengthen their national climate targets under the Paris Agreement. In February, Norway submitted an enhanced climate target for 2030. I encourage other countries to enhance their ambitions, especially the large economies. We must also give priority to further development of rules and cooperation under the Paris Agreement Norway is actively speeding up the green shift in our economy, making it cheaper to be green, and more expensive to pollute.   President, The oceans are a vital factor if we are to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. The COVID-19 crisis has underlined the importance of the ocean economy. We need to build back not only better and greener, but also bluer. A sustainable ocean economy holds benefits for health and society, as well as for the global economy and environment. Every dollar invested in key ocean actions yields 5 dollars in return, often more. Actions include increasing sustainable seafood production, decarbonising international shipping, scaling up offshore wind power and conserving and restoring mangroves. Responsible resource management increases the potential for economic growth. Two years ago, I convened the High-level Panel on Building a Sustainable Ocean Economy, together with the president of Palau. The panel is comprised of fourteen distinguished members. On December 3rd we will present ways forward to better protect our ocean and release the enormous economic potential it holds. Our recommendations are based on the best advice from more than 150 international scientists and a wide network of business and NGOs. We will invite the international community to join this call for ocean action leading up to the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon next year.   President, I would like to draw attention to the challenges seafarers are facing in this crisis.  Around 500,000 seafarers currently await to disembark or embark ships and vessels globally.  Almost 80 % of the world’s trade is transported by ship, including food, medical equipment and energy products. If the crisis persists, it can lead to major disruption of global trade, supply chains and the world economy.  I encourage all member states to designate seafarers as key workers and to implement the International Maritime Organisation´s protocols for crew changes.   President, COVID-19 is putting us all to the test. Information, research, treatment and vaccines must be shared in a way that leaves no-one behind. If not, we all stand to lose. I started by saying that the United Nations was born out of hope. While we can always do better, I find hope in the way we have come together in this race against time. We are united against a common enemy. We have been reminded of a simple fact: We are in this together. - There is no stronger argument for our continued support for the United Nations. Thank you, and stay safe","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/norges-hovedinnlegg-under-fns-generalforsamling/id2766169/"
"11"," Introductory remarks at the press conference on December 2020 ",2020-12-18,"Welcome to the last of the many press conferences you have attended in this year. Well, this is the final one with me, at least. This will not be quite the same as in previous years. But most things this year have been different from what they normally are.   New situations generate new vocabulary in our language. Words to describe what we are experiencing. Things we haven’t needed to describe before. This year, there has been a lot we have never experienced before. Self-isolation at home Digital after-work drinks Quarantine body Overnight digitalisation Emergency national team COVID-19 police Social bubble Distanced walk   None of us had heard of any of these phrases just nine months ago. Now, some of them are part of our daily speech. We are all looking forward to the day when we don’t need these phrases any more. Except for one: COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday, we announced that the first approved vaccine may arrive before the end of the year. Planning for this is already well under way here in Norway. All municipalities are to have drawn up their vaccination plans by 18 December. Equipment for administering vaccines has been ordered and will be delivered throughout the country. Syringes, hypodermic needles, antiseptic wipes and freezers are being sent out. It is possible that we will be able to vaccinate the first group of people here in Norway just before or after the turn of the year. This marks the beginning of the end of the crisis that we have lived with for most of this year. But it will take some time before we can truly say that the crisis is over. Because it will take some time before we manage to complete the full vaccination programme.   The year we are soon putting behind us has largely revolved around COVID-19. And the new situations we encountered have not just required us to coin new terminology. They have also required us to take action. And to put it bluntly: I have done many things during the past nine months that I never imagined I would find myself doing. I never imagined I would need to have an opinion about how many guests people should have in their own homes on Christmas Eve. Or about how much distance there had to be between you and another spectator at a football match. Nor did I ever imagine I would ask the Minister of Finance on a Tuesday to submit a proposition to the Storting for billions of kroner. And expect it to be presented the following Friday. And I can report that the expressions on the faces of my staff at the time revealed that they never imagined this happening either. That was the first of the seven crisis packages we put together. The situation since March has demanded rapid action and required us to take decisions that are fraught with uncertainty. Uncertainty about the coronavirus itself and how it spreads, about the impacts of the measures implemented, and about the ensuing economic ramifications at home and abroad. This is why I have said, again and again, that we will make some mistakes. That we have to learn as we go. When dealing with uncertainty of this magnitude, it is essential that we are able to correct our course, but we must also dare to act. That is what we have done our best to achieve. And according to the OECD, Norway is one of the countries that has coped best with the pandemic thus far, both in terms of the nation’s health and in terms of its economy. COVID-19 has taken fewer lives here in Norway than most other places. Fewer people have become severely ill. So we have avoided undue strain on our health services. And we have experienced a far less dramatic economic downturn than many other countries. But the crisis is not over. And we have seen how quickly the situation can change. This is why our economic policy must constantly be adjusted to the infection situation. The schemes that are in place now correspond to the wave we currently find ourselves in. If we factor in all the compensatory measures introduced in 2020, the public sector has covered well over half the losses sustained by households and businesses. Thus far, over 34 000 companies have received support through the compensation scheme. Over 2 000 businesses have applied for grants under the subsidy scheme to take back temporarily laid-off workers. 13 000 person-months have been taken back from layoffs. And more than 3 700 businesses have been granted loans under the loan guarantee scheme. Some will say that the expenditures are too high. I believe it has been both right and necessary to use this much money to counteract the negative impacts of the pandemic and the infection control measures. Supporting businesses has been the right thing to do. Because saving viable businesses means saving people’s jobs. The foundation for our welfare-based society. And there have been many jobs that need saving. Unemployment in April was record high. Today, the number of job-seekers is less than half of what it was then. That is a very good result. According to the latest figures, the number of job-seekers has begun to decline again. So far in December, there are roughly 1 300 fewer people looking for jobs. Now our task is to prevent unemployment from stagnating at a high level.   The COVID-19 pandemic is not the first crisis my Government has dealt with. But it has a broader scope than any other crisis in our country in recent times. It goes without saying that COVID-19 has taken a great deal of our time and consumed much of our capacity. And if I were to say everything I could about that, we would be here for three hours. At least. Alongside the crisis, it has been important for me to keep a focus on the long-term challenges facing Norway. And to continue to deliver solutions targeted towards the future. And the Government has made progress – on small and larger-scale issues alike. Some examples include the: The list is much longer, but let me instead focus on some of the broader issues. That will have a profound influence on Norway in the years ahead. But that have not received as much attention as our crisis management.    In the field of justice, we have concluded the broadest judicial sector reform in modern times. This will enhance the exercise of due process and reduce court waiting times, and will also increase activities in the district courts. The police reform is another reform we are beginning to reap the benefits of. For the first time, the police have met their targets for response times in all three urban categories. It takes less time for the police to reach the scene after they are notified of an incident. 2020 is also the year when the Government met its target of two police officers per 1 000 inhabitants. This was widely celebrated by the Norwegian Police Union. Norway now has the strongest police force in modern times, with an increase of 2 100 person-years since 2013. All together, staffing levels in the police have increased by more than 3 200 person-years. This is a greater increase in number of staff than in any other public agency.   A lot has happened in the field of transport as well. A number of road construction projects across the country have been launched, continued or completed during this year. By the end of 2020, this Government will have opened nearly 800 kilometres of new roads – with 330 of these opened in the past two years. This has improved safety and reduced travel times. And that really means something. The drive from Ålesund to Oslo now takes approximately 1.5 hours less than it did in 2009.  And the travel time along E6 between Oslo and Trondheim and E18 between Oslo and Kristiansand have also been reduced by nearly 1.5 hours. An increasing number of the cars on the road now are electric. Just to put the developments into context: The very first Nissan Leaf was sold in Norway two years before I became Prime Minister. Today, it is one of the most popular cars sold in Norway. In October, 60 % of the new cars sold were electric cars. This has not happened all by itself. This is the result of a targeted policy to promote a greener national car fleet. And on the subject of green developments: we have achieved a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions this year as well. Emissions in Norway are now at the lowest level in 27 years. That is something we should be proud of. But there is still much to be done. In February of this year, Norway became the third country in the world to submit a more ambitious climate target to the UN. We have raised our target levels substantially. From minimum 40 % cut in emissions. To at least 50 % and up to 55 % from the 1990 level. We have also encouraged the EU to increase its climate target for 2030 to 55 %. Last week we heard the good news that the EU heads of state have decided to do just that. Norway’s climate policy is closely linked to EU climate policy. We apply slightly more stringent rules for calculating emissions reductions than the EU currently uses. And after the turn of the year the Government will present a climate policy plan showing how we intend reach our targets. A key part of the plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without curtailing development. One of the measures was launched this autumn: the Langship project. This is the largest climate project initiated in Norwegian industry. It is designed to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is both safe and possible. At the same time, it will help to preserve, restructure and create new industry and business activity in Norway. Another key element in the effort to reduce emissions and promote green growth is research. The Government has decided that Norway will take part in the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. You may think that sounds a bit dry. But it is a gold mine for Norwegian businesses. Because it gives them the same access to research capital as all the other businesses in the EU. And that is beneficial for Norway. Recent figures show that Norwegian participants have brought home 2.26 % of the amount provided to Horizon 2020. That equals more than NOK 13 billion in research funding. Thanks to targeted initiatives, budgets for research and development have increased by 55 % since 2013.   It is not possible to talk about international cooperation without mentioning the UN Security Council. While there may be some in Norway who have wondered whether there is any point to our taking a seat on the Council, the world is clearly convinced that there is. Norway received the most votes of the three candidates we were competing against for a seat in the Council. We have built alliances around ocean issues and efforts to improve global health and education. Now we will safeguard Norwegian interests and shoulder our share of responsibility in some of the most difficult questions facing the world. This is no easy task. But it is important that countries like Norway do their part. And finally, I would like to mention Brexit. Starting in January, the framework for our trade with the United Kingdom will change substantially. We have been preparing ourselves for various scenarios since it became clear that Brexit was inevitable. This includes the ‘no deal’ outcome. Norway is well prepared for most of the situations that can arise. We have made sure that there will be no tariff increases in trade between Norway and the UK. That air traffic can continue uninterrupted. And that the rights of citizens will be safeguarded. But we cannot safeguard businesses against what happens in the UK. We are concerned, for example, that customs procedures will become more laborious when all trade between the EU and the UK has to pass through border controls for the first time in many years. The result may be bottlenecks and long queues for those crossing the border into the UK from 1 January. I believe that as time goes on, we will see even more clearly how complicated it is to leave the European Economic Community. Political parties in Norway that think it is a good idea to leave the EEA because we can negotiate new, better agreements should look more closely across the North Sea. First, the UK has still not succeeded in negotiating a deal with the EU. Second, estimates indicate that the British economy will be subject to rapid decline. GDP will permanently be 4 % lower than if they had remained in the EU. That is more than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Norwegian economy. And third, is it really likely that little Norway will succeed in obtaining a better agreement with the EU than a major power like the UK if we decide to pull out of the EEA? I don’t think so. Which is why I say, yet again: As long as I am Prime Minister, gambling with the EEA Agreement is not an option. The EEA Agreement provides the most essential operating parameter for Norwegian companies and Norwegian jobs.   The purpose of this press conference is to sum up our efforts, and I have nearly reached the end of my remarks. But I think it is important to say a few words looking forward as well. There are two fundamental questions that politicians have to answer. Question 1: How can we succeed in creating more private sector jobs and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Question 2: What do we need to do to include a greater number of people in working life, and ensure that fewer are left behind? How we answer these will be vital in promoting a sustainable welfare-based society for tomorrow. This was the case before COVID-19, and it will be the case after COVID-19. The answers to these questions involve much of what I have already talked about today. They involve research, green technology, infrastructure and market access for Norwegian exports. Norway has seen progress in all of these areas. The statistics and results speak for themselves. But it also involves something more: access to expertise. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, six of ten companies said they lacked staff with relevant skills. And through the months of the pandemic, we have seen that the first to be laid off are precisely those who have little or no formal competency. When I speak of greater inclusion, I am referring to two things: One: that companies have good enough conditions to increase their demand for labour. And two: that we must make it possible for more people to enter working life. Those who have been laid off or lost their jobs now must use their time to seek more education and acquire new skills. To make it easier to return to the job they had before. Or qualify for a new job. In its 2020 initiative to boost education, the Government has proposed allocating NOK 2.5 billion for precisely this purpose.  This money is to be used for: The education initiative includes these measures and more. Today we are also circulating for review a proposal that will make it easier to combine unemployment benefits with pursuing an education. This has been a temporary measure introduced during the COVID-19 crisis. We believe this scheme should be made permanent. This proposal is designed to ensure that unemployed individuals do not opt out of opportunities to enhance their job qualifications because it means losing their unemployment benefit. Specifically, we propose that fully unemployed and fully laid-off individuals are able to combine training with receiving unemployment benefit. For basic and upper secondary education and vocational training, the scheme will only be available to individuals aged 25 years or older. For higher education, the minimum age is 30. The age requirements have been established to avoid a situation in which unemployment benefits comprise a realistic alternative to studies financed through the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund. This proposal represents a radical shift away from current thinking that a person is either unemployed, actively seeking work and receiving unemployment benefits. Or is working to qualify for jobs. It acknowledges that our labour market has changed. And that people should also have the chance to pursue new skills and knowledge while they are unemployed. Instead of thinking of the work dimension and the skills dimension as separate entities, we have to view these as something that can be combined. This is a step towards fulfilling our vision of lifelong learning for everyone. And that no one becomes obsolete in the workplace.   Now it is time to give the floor to you. But first I would like to take the opportunity to thank the media for excellent cooperation in 2020. I wish you all an enjoyable, peaceful, adequately socially-distanced holiday celebration!","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/prime-ministers-introductory-remarks-at-the-press-conference-on-december-2020/id2814560/"
"12"," Statement on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action ",2020-10-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, Twenty-five years ago, we agreed on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. And we do have much to celebrate today – women play a greater role in political and economic life. More girls are in school than ever before, and fewer women die in childbirth.  However, COVID-19 has highlighted how easily these achievements can be reversed. There is an alarming increase in women´s poverty. The risks of early pregnancy and harmful practices, such as child marriages, are growing. Acts of violence against women and girls have increased across the world.  So our response to this crisis must have a gender perspective at its core. Our recovery efforts must ensure that girls go back to school. That women are part of decision making processes. That they can access health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. And that efforts to rebuild and stimulate the economy are targeted at women.  The fact is that we will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals without investing in women and girls. The Norwegian Government recognizes the vital role young people play as partners and leaders in development. We are dependent on the hard work of committed girls and young women to achieve the targets set out in the Beijing Platform for Action. I would therefore like to give the floor to our youth delegate Celia Lima. Beijing +25 Youth delegate Celia Lima: As we mark the anniversary of the Beijing declaration, we stand on the shoulders of the women and queer people who fought for the rights we enjoy today. The Beijing declaration was, and is, radical. But looking at the status of women globally, 25 years later, it is clear: to reach the 2030 Agenda, decision-makers need to be pressured by the impatient voices of youth.  Globally, youth are a powerful force for radical change. When the space for young women’s participation is widened, our claims to equal opportunities to education, work and a life free from violence can no longer be ignored. I urge every UN member state to commit to ensuring meaningful youth participation in all processes that concern youth, and to take the particular actions needed for young women and girls’ voices to be heard. Because “Nothing about us, without us”.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/statement-on-the-twenty-fifth-anniversary-of-the-beijing-declaration-and-platform-for-action/id2767333/"
"13"," PM Solbergs speech at Virtual Ocean Dialogues ",2020-06-04,"Unfortunately, we cannot be together in person this week at the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon. We are nonetheless linked today by our concern for the future of our blue planet. The pandemic has disrupted lives, communities and economies worldwide. Including the over 3 billion people who depend on the ocean for their livelihoods and wellbeing. Nature should be part of our recovery from this crisis. Central to this are the many benefits found in a sustainable ocean. But we need to act fast to reverse the decline in ocean health. We must act now, and we must be open-minded to the possibilities of tomorrow. We should fast-track and invest in innovative solutions that enable a rapid transition to a sustainable ocean economy. An example is the enzymes found in microbes on the deep ocean floor, which are used to produce tests for COVID-19. Another is the brand new pledge by Norwegian ship owners that by 2030, they will order only zero emission vessels in order to have a climate neutral fleet by 2050. It is essential that blue is part of the green recovery that is now so widely discussed. A sustainable ocean economy offers many opportunities for resetting and rebuilding economies that enhance both the health of our environment and our climate. Remember that ocean-based climate action could reduce the emissions gap by up to 21% by 2050. This is equivalent to taking more than a billion cars off the road each year. I have the pleasure of serving as the co-chair of the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, composed of 14 heads of government and states. Our countries represent nearly: Driven by a commitment to partnership, shared knowledge and science-informed policy, we have spent the last 18 months working with business, science and civil society to advance the benefits of a sustainable ocean economy. We have learnt that protection, production and prosperity must go hand in hand. Within the coming year the Ocean Panel will present an action agenda which makes the case for a healthy and sustainably managed ocean. The agenda will outline how a well-managed ocean can deliver for global economic recovery, human health, and improved food and energy security for all. We need to rebuild resilience back into natural systems. Then we can make sure we are less vulnerable to future shocks and that nobody is left behind as our economies recover, reset and rebuild. Friends and fellow ocean champions, I urge us all to keep the ocean’s many values on our minds as we decide what is best for our economies, wellbeing and environment. The health of the planet – our entire blue planet – depends on it.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/friends-of-ocean-actions-virtual-ocean-dialogues/id2705030/"
"14"," Reopening of borders to allow holiday and leisure travel between Norway and Denmark ",2020-05-29,"Norway and Denmark have agreed to reopen their borders for holiday and leisure travel between the two countries from 15 June. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is announcing this at the same time as I am holding this press conference here. Our agreement means that from 15 June, residents of Denmark will be able to come to Norway and Norwegian residents will be able to travel to Denmark.  But before anyone reaches for their laptop to book a trip, I would like to point out that tourists in both countries must familiarise themselves with and follow national rules on travel and infection control. These rules will not necessarily be exactly the same in Norway and Denmark. Our decision to allow travel between Norway and Denmark is based on some key principles. We will be using the framework and principles that we have agreed with Denmark as a basis for dialogue with the other Nordic countries. We have informed them that we may be able to reopen our borders to their countries for holiday and leisure travel by 15 June, based on the same principles as we have now agreed with Denmark. We will now talk to Iceland, Sweden and Finland. There are now areas in all the Nordic countries where the level of infection is low, but there are also areas in some of them where the infection is not under good enough control. This means that we cannot allow free travel throughout the Nordic region immediately. And this explains why the principles I am now going to talk about are vital as we start to reopen our borders. The principles are as follows: In addition to these points, each country may have its own rules and guidelines in place. We are aware that the Danish authorities have said that they want to retain restrictions on staying in Copenhagen. The information we have received from the Danish authorities today also states that anyone arriving in Denmark must have booked accommodation for several nights before arrival.  Tourists from Norway will have to comply with this and with any other Danish national rules. So, before you travel, you must make sure that you know what the current rules and guidelines are in Denmark and make sure you obey them. The rules may change so it is a good idea to read the travel information on the website of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Norway has not introduced any specific restrictions for visitors from Denmark. Ties between Denmark and Norway are close. I am therefore very pleased that we can now start to reopen our borders for travel, tourism and cross-border cooperation. This is good for the business sector and for jobs in both countries.  The agreement between Norway and Denmark means that quarantine on arrival and entry restrictions are now being waived for Danish residents coming to Norway and Norwegian residents who have been in Denmark.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still advising against non-essential travel to all countries other than Denmark. The changes we are making now are a first step towards a gradual, controlled lifting of travel restrictions in Europe.  The health authorities will monitor the effects of what we are now doing, with a view to keeping the level of infection in Norway low. There is still a great deal of work that needs to be done by 15 June. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security will be responsible for this work. We will provide information about travel to the other Nordic countries by 15 June. And the travel advice for certain other European countries will be reviewed by 20 July.  In the meantime, we will continuously assess where and how it is responsible to allow travel. We do not want to have travel restrictions in place any longer than is necessary. As soon as the infection situation makes it possible to change the travel advice, we will do so.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/reopening-of-borders-to-allow-holiday-and-leisure-travel-between-norway-and-denmark/id2704557/"
"15"," Introduction at press conference on further corona measures ",2020-05-07,"Good evening, everyone, Today it is eight weeks since we introduced the most severe restrictions Norway has ever faced in peacetime. This has been an extraordinary time for us all. A time we will remember for as long as we live. We promised early on that if we managed to suppress the virus, we would start to open up again as soon as we could.  The Norwegian people have given us their confidence and remained patient in the face of strict restrictions on their activities. Now it is our turn to keep our promise.  That is why the Government is presenting a strategy and a plan for opening up Norway again before the summer. A plan for getting back to our normal everyday lives. I would like to say that I am very relieved that we have got this far. Now we are talking about the order in which we should open up society again, not about what we have to close down. This shows that our strategy has worked. And every one of us has played a part in this. I want to thank you all for your efforts. Until now, our strategy has been to suppress the virus. Now we are moving on to a control strategy, focusing on limiting the spread of infection. But the underlying aim is still the same. We must make sure that our health system has the capacity to help everyone who needs it – both those suffering from COVID-19 and those with other health issues.  That is why the plan we are presenting today will only work if we continue to keep the spread of infection under control. This means that we must lift restrictions and open up society again cautiously and gradually, and we must do this together. And I realise that many people are feeling impatient, and that you may be able to come up with good reasons why ‘your’ activity should be permitted.  It may also be difficult to understand why one activity is permitted while another is not. The answer is that if we try to accommodate everyone’s wishes, we will open up too quickly and the spread of infection will increase again. In that case, we would have to close everything down again. That is why we have to set priorities. The Government has chosen to give priority to children and young people first. Then people’s workplaces, and after that, other activities. The detailed plan will be published online. But there are some important dates to note.  From Monday 11 May, all schools can open again. On 15 May, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health will present new advice on holiday and leisure travel On 1 June, bars and other establishments that do not serve food and amusement parks can reopen. And from 15 June, it will be possible to hold events with up to 200 people present. Our aim is to lift most of the restrictions by 15 June. But – and this is a big but – we will only lift the restrictions on these dates if we manage to keep the spread of infection under control. So we all still have a great deal of personal responsibility. We cannot allow ourselves greater freedom than the infection control rules permit. For a long time to come, we will have to continue to keep at least one metre apart, stay at home when we are ill and wash our hands often and thoroughly. These are the simplest, most effective and least invasive measures that will help us get back to our normal everyday lives.  I know that a lot of people are wondering when they will be able to travel abroad again. The answer is that we simply don’t know. This is not something that Norway can decide on its own. It is something we must do in cooperation with other countries. We are working on this, but unfortunately, it is too early to give you a date. Before I hand over to Minister of Health and Care Services, Bent Høie, I would like to say this: all of us have done a good job in this concerted national effort. And we have managed to avoid a crisis in our health system. Now we have to act in solidarity with all those affected by the economic crisis. That is why I am asking you all to keep up the national effort. We must limit the spread of infection, get people back to work and return to our normal everyday lives.  We can do this if we all pull together.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/introduction-at-press-conference/id2701526/"
"16"," Prime Minister’s introduction at press conference on measures to support the oil and gas industry and green transformation ",2020-04-30,"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices have put the industry in an extremely difficult situation. Both companies and employees are facing a great deal of uncertainty. And if there is one thing that is important to us, it’s to reduce uncertainty where we can. That is why we are announcing these proposals today, with the aim of maintaining activity in the oil and gas sector. The Government will submit its taxation proposals to the Storting together with this year’s revised national budget. This is also part of our response to the Storting’s request for the Government to consider a range of instruments to stimulate investments in the oil and gas industry and the Norwegian supply industry.  We are also announcing a green restructuring package to strengthen competitiveness, facilitate restructuring and promote further emission cuts in the Norwegian business sector once the crisis is over. A successful exit strategy will require greener approaches, secure jobs, and a strong competitive position. Our oil and gas resources have enabled us to create large numbers of jobs and build up a unique economic position, and they have made a huge contribution to our welfare and prosperity. Now we must make sure that the industry that has been the engine of Norway’s economy does not grind to a halt. The coronavirus crisis is hitting both the Norwegian and the global economy hard. The oil market is highly volatile, which is why we announced cuts in production on the Norwegian shelf yesterday. Our aim is to promote stability in the oil market. The situation is exacerbated because oil companies are also being hit hard by the crisis and have responded by putting planned development and maintenance projects on hold. Orders are being postponed or cancelled. And the effects are being felt by people in this country, including those working in industrial enterprises all along the Norwegian coast and in the supply industry in all parts of the country. Many of these companies provide vital jobs in areas outside the major population centres, in communities from Kirkenes to Notodden to Karmøy.  The Government has been working for a long time to ensure the transformation of Norwegian business and industry. We were on the way to becoming less dependent on the oil and gas industry even before the crisis began. The people, the knowledge and the expertise we have in our oil and gas industry will also be crucial to Norway’s green transformation. Unless we take steps now to support these jobs and companies, we risk losing what we have invested over the past 50-60 years.  There are two things we have to do now: we must make sure that companies and jobs survive the crisis, and at the same time we must retain Norwegian expertise, maintain our competitive position, and strengthen the basis for a green transformation process. This is why we are proposing temporary, time-limited amendments to the tax system for oil and gas companies. The most important of these is that the depreciation rules for investments, or uplift rules, are being amended. This means that the companies’ tax bills will be postponed. The companies can benefit from deductions from the tax base more quickly and their liquidity will improve. This will make it easier to carry out development projects that create jobs and maintain activity, even though the tax rate is being kept at 78 %. Our aim is to curb the decline in activity, to ensure that more people have a job to go to, and to keep valuable expertise in Norway.  The changes to the taxation system will give companies additional liquidity, estimated at NOK 100 billion this year and next year combined. This will help to reduce the decline in orders that the supply industry is experiencing. The oil and gas industry has ambitious plans to cut emissions through electrification, and this work is vital. Minister of Children and Families Kjell Ingolf Ropstad will say a bit more about this afterwards. The Government considers it important to ensure that the economic incentives for implementing planned electrification projects on the continental shelf are not weakened. We are therefore trying to ensure that companies’ emission costs in the time ahead remain at about the same level as before the crisis. We want to help the business sector to become more adaptable, as this will be important for reducing emissions and finding new solutions. The supply industry will play a vital role here.  That is why we are now announcing a new green restructuring package for the business sector, which will be presented to the Storting towards the end of May. This package will focus on how we can enhance our expertise, knowledge and technology. It will include increases in funding for Enova, for research, development and innovation, and for green shipping. Minister of Trade and Industry Iselin Nybø will say more about the green restructuring package. The proposals we are announcing today have a dual purpose: to safeguard jobs today and to ensure progress in the green transformation we must seek to achieve in the future.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/prime-ministers-introduction-at-press-conference-on-measures-to-support-the-oil-and-gas-industry-and-green-transformation/id2700663/"
"17"," Prime Minister’s remarks at press conference on changes to the coronavirus measures ",2020-04-08,"Twenty-six long days have passed since we so drastically changed how we live our lives. During this period, we have asked a lot of each of you. The response we received has been one of enormous patience and willpower in the face of strict infection control measures. Although it has been difficult. Although we are more isolated. Although we miss all the things we otherwise take for granted, we have been listening dutifully to the health authorities and their advice. It is my sense that everyone wants to take part in this collective effort. That everyone wants to help suppress the contagion. So we will have a health service that is able to help all of us when we need it. These days have shown us what we are made of. They have shown that we are willing to pitch in for the common good. That we will go to great lengths to help each other. That we all step up when it really counts. And not least: that we stand together. These weeks have shown Norway at its best. On behalf of the entire Government, I would like to express thanks to everyone who has helped us to reduce the spread of the infection so that we can now begin to approach the virus in somewhat different ways. The virus has exacted a heavy cost. Many Norwegians have lost their lives. Their families are entering into the Easter holiday period without their loved ones. To you, I send my warmest thoughts. The virus has also paralysed our business community. Our workplaces. As we start the Easter holiday, 400 000 Norwegians are without a job. Most of them because they have been temporarily laid off. To you I want to say that we are doing everything in our power to control the infection and to ensure that businesses and jobs will be there when the coronavirus crisis is over. Together with the parties in the Storting, we have designed programmes and schemes which we hope will make a very difficult situation a little easier. It is costly, but worth it. Everyone has seen the pictures and read the horror stories from other European countries where the health care system has collapsed. Our goal is not to end up in that situation. The Government today has decided which measures to deploy in the continuing fight against the virus. We have done so on the basis of new analyses by the Institute of Public Health and advice provided by the Directorate of Health. The new analyses provide a basis for cautious optimism. We can see that the infection curve has levelled off and that our infection control measures are working. Together, we have achieved the goal of ensuring that each patient on average only passes the infection on to one other person. As you heard yesterday, that figure is now estimated at 0.7. It is gratifying. But it is just a snapshot. I feel a strong need to emphasise that we cannot just lower our shoulders in the belief that we can now lean back into our everyday lives as they were before. We are still far from halftime, if we compare this battle to a football match. But with solid team play, Norway has managed to get the virus under control. The job now is to maintain that control. Therefore, we will keep doing what we know works. We will continue the virus-suppression strategy, but with some adjustment to the measures now in effect. The changes we will now introduce we will do together, cautiously, and taking our time – three key elements to keep in mind. Before we revise the strategy itself – and significantly change the measures that have been limiting contact between us – we must have better ways of tracing the infection. We must be able to test more people, more frequently. And we must put in place a system for more rapid and more effective isolation of those who are ill. To those of you who think this is taking too long: I understand your impatience. If we succeed in controlling the infection going forward, we can ease the restrictions more. But if we fail, we must make them more stringent again. The Government today has decided to introduce seven changes. All of them require the application of sound infection control rules. Therefore, the Institute of Public Health in concert with professional and industry organisations will have to work out infection control standards in the different areas. When these are complete and ready for use, we will do the following: From 20 April, we will open the country’s day-care centres. From 27 April, pupils in primary school years 1–4 will go back to school and to out-of-school care programmes. This should give the day-care centres and schools plenty of time to plan for re-opening. Parents, children and staff must all be confident that the necessary infection control measures are in place. Our ambition is for all pupils, to return to school before the summer in one way or another. Starting 27 April, we will re-open upper secondary school for second- and third-year pupils who are following vocational programmes, provided that this can be done in a way that meets infection control guidelines. Starting 27 April, we will also permit some students who are at the end of their studies, and who are dependent on using facilities and equipment at their institution, to return to universities, university colleges and vocational technical colleges. The same applies to employees in recruitment positions who are in the final stage of their projects. Minister of Education and Integration Guri Melby will say more about this afterwards, but I would like to stress that students may only return to carry out activities that are essential, and that infection control measures must be adhered to. Starting 20 April, health practitioners who perform one-to-one services, such as psychologists, opticians and physiotherapists, will be able to resume much of their activity. By 27 April at the latest, we will allow services where there is one-to-one contact, such as hairdressers, massage and skin care professionals to resume contingent on compliance with the standards that are to be prepared. Everyone will be given time to familiarise themselves with the standards, prepare themselves sufficiently and ensure they have the necessary infection control equipment to do their jobs. Starting 20 April, it will also be possible for people to stay overnight at their holiday cabins. The recommendation to limit unnecessary leisure travel remains in effect. We must continue to restrict our movement patterns in order to keep COVID-19 from flaring up again. I have now gone through the restrictions we will be easing at this juncture. Other things will not be changed. Large sports and cultural events will not be possible until 15 June. By 1 May, we will return with a new assessment for the summer with respect to major sports and cultural events. It is a matter of providing predictability for the organisers and seeing how well our infection control measures are working. As we now ease the restrictions somewhat, I must emphasise as strongly as possible that this does not mean we can allow ourselves to grow more careless in other areas. All other measures and guidance remain in effect, whether applicable to groups, large congregations or other forms of social life. Those who can work from home must continue to do so. We must still be conscientious about following the rules on social distancing. We must wash our hands just as often, cough into our elbows and take all hygienic and infection control measures seriously. Anyone experiencing symptoms must stay at home. Quarantine and isolation rules must be respected as scrupulously as before. If we become more careless in our everyday lives, the virus may spread out of control. If it does, we will have to tighten the measures again. We Norwegians are known for our ability to mount vigorous, all-out efforts. But when it comes to controlling a contagious virus, that is not what’s needed. Instead we must demonstrate long-term perseverance. Together we have achieved the goal of suppressing the virus. Together we will maintain control over the virus in the time before us. And then – also together – we will be able to reclaim our everyday lives.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2020/prime-ministers-remarks-at-press-conference-on-changes-to-the-coronavirus-measures2/id2697078/"
"18"," The COVID-19 situation ",2021-03-09,"I would like to thank you for this opportunity to brief the Storting on the status and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The infection situation Nearly a year has gone by since we introduced the most comprehensive set of measures ever implemented in peacetime. During the course of this year, more than 4 million tests have been carried out, 75 000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, 3 400 people have been admitted to hospital and 632 coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded. The virus has affected the lives of many people, and the fight to limit the spread of infection has affected even more. But Norway has fared better than most other countries. Since we succeeded in reducing the spread of infection late last winter, we have managed to keep the virus under control, also through various new waves of infection. But the pandemic is unpredictable. At the beginning of January, we tightened restrictions, both at Norway’s borders and within the country. This proved effective, and infection levels declined during the month of January. It also probably helped to delay the spread in Norway of the more infectious virus variants that were on the increase in other countries. In the past few weeks, the numbers have been rising again, and the more infectious variants are in the process of becoming predominant. The R number is now estimated to be 1.3. That is too high. There have been a variety of outbreaks in different parts of the country, for example in Ulvik, Bodø, Harstad, Kristiansand and Oslo. There have been outbreaks in hospitals, via sports activities, in workplaces, schools and day-care centres. Most of the recent outbreaks have been caused by a more infectious virus variant. While infection levels have increased in 8 out of 10 counties, a large proportion of the new cases are emerging in just a few counties. In recent weeks, around 70 % of all cases have been registered in Oslo and Viken. It is estimated that the UK variant of the virus accounts for around 70 % of the cases in these areas.  This variant is more easily transmissible, and is likely to carry a higher risk of serious illness and therefore lead to more hospital admissions. At the same time, we know that we have vaccines that provide protection against the mutated virus too. And we know that is possible to suppress it with tried and tested measures. Infection levels have risen in all age groups. But now the numbers are highest among the younger age groups, with the sharpest increase among those aged 13 to 19, followed by those aged 20 to 39. It is not surprising that cases are rising most rapidly among young people, as it is the restrictions for these groups that have been eased the most. Fortunately, another number is also rising, and that is the number of people who have been vaccinated. Over 600 000 doses of the vaccine have been administered. And although it is reassuring to know that the oldest among us are now well protected by the vaccine, there are still too many people who could become seriously ill with COVID-19 if we do not continue efforts to limit the spread of infection.  People in the younger age groups can become seriously ill too. And it is not always easy to know whether another person has an underlying disease. The increase in infection levels has led to a rise in the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital. We are now back up to the level we were seeing in January. Hospitals in and around Oslo have seen the largest increase in new patients.  Infection levels are rising in many other countries as well. Several of these are now introducing stringent measures to prevent an escalating third wave of coronavirus. The increasing predominance of new variants of the virus is making it more difficult to keep the spread of infection under control. It has therefore been necessary to introduce tighter restrictions in many municipalities. We have seen that many municipalities have managed to suppress outbreaks of the mutated virus. But the situation is unstable.  Madam President, It is essential that we manage to keep the spread of infection under control. If we succeed in keeping infection levels down in March and April, we will be able to start to ease restrictions in May.  There is still another uphill battle ahead. Division of tasks and responsibilities between the local and state levels The state and the municipalities have different tasks and responsibilities when it comes to preventing and managing the spread of infection. Under the Act relating to the control of communicable diseases, both the municipalities and the Government have the authority to introduce infection control measures that are necessary and proportionate in order to combat the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic we have had national measures in place, including requirements relating to enterprises and limits on how many people can congregate in one place. The national measures have set a minimum level for restrictions across the country. No municipality may have a lower level of restrictions. As we work to suppress the more infectious mutated variants, it is important that all municipalities support, and ensure adequate compliance with, the national measures. But municipalities may have a higher level of restrictions. When dealing with local outbreaks, tighter local restrictions are often needed. The basic principle has been that the municipalities themselves are to take the decision to implement stricter local measures. The Government may also introduce measures that apply to parts of the country, when this is necessary to manage the situation. This may be called for in the event of major outbreaks when there is a need to coordinate the response quickly across multiple municipalities.  When outbreaks occur, county governors, the affected municipalities, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Directorate of Health work together to assess what measures are needed. They also consider who should decide on any local measures: the individual municipalities themselves or the Government.  The first time the Government took the decision to impose stricter local and regional measures was in January in connection with the outbreak in Nordre Follo municipality. Since then, the Government has also adopted measures to be implemented in a number of other municipalities, for example in Western Norway and in Vestfold og Telemark county. The national measures imposed by the Government have been replaced by municipal rules once the infection situation has been clarified. So far, all municipalities have agreed, and indeed have themselves requested, that it should be the Government that introduces and adjusts measures when this is necessary to manage the situation. The Government has developed a three-level system of measures, set out in the COVID-19 regulations, that can be deployed very rapidly if and when the need arises. Level A encompasses the strictest level of measures, and level C the least stringent. We listened to the feedback we received that the first version of the system was too complicated, and we have now simplified and improved the system. Measures at the regional level have proved to be a good approach. Cooperation with the affected municipalities, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the county governors has been very constructive. In line with advice from the Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health, the Government has decided it is best to allow the locally adopted measures to be in effect for a few days before we draw any final conclusions about whether these measures are enough to bring infection levels down. Local measures are well targeted and enjoy a high degree of credibility at local level. But it is essential that they are sufficiently restrictive, that they are well coordinated and that they suppress outbreaks quickly enough. There are two aspects of the local response that the Government is seeking improve. In some cases, municipalities have taken too long to implement adequate restrictions and coordinate their efforts.  The Institute of Public Health has therefore clarified its guidelines to the municipalities on how to implement measures swiftly, coordinate the response and ensure the appropriate level of restrictions. The emergency authority granted to the Chief Municipal Medical Officer to implement necessary measures is of crucial importance in such situations.  It means that the necessary measures can be implemented quickly by the Chief Municipal Medical Officer, ideally coordinated with the efforts of colleagues in neighbouring municipalities. At the same time, it gives the municipality’s democratically elected representatives time to determine the longer-term level of restrictions needed. This prevents the loss of valuable time. The work of testing and tracing infections can be done before the infection has had time to spread. In this way, the virus can be suppressed effectively without the need for long-term restrictions.  This must be the main model for the local response as we move forward.  The second aspect the Government will focus on is lowering the threshold for when the Government should step in and take decisions about the level of restrictions on behalf of the municipalities. This will apply when: It may also be appropriate for the Government to implement regional measures if the number of new cases continues to rise in parts of the country where infection levels are already high. The municipalities will always have the opportunity to decide on measures first. That is what the Government wants as well. In situations where it is necessary for the Government to intervene, there will be a dialogue with the municipality in question and the aim will always be to hand responsibility back to the municipality as soon as the situation makes this possible. We are announcing this now because it is essential that local measures are effective if we are to avoid a new round of national restrictions. Madam President, The Government’s long-term strategy explains the choice of goals and measures in the Government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. We also have an emergency preparedness plan that provides overall guidelines for assessing and taking decisions on measures at national, regional and local level. These form the basis for our assessment of the measures needed, which helps to ensure a degree of predictability, even in situations where the infection situation is highly unpredictable. It is vital that we reduce the spread of infection. If we allow the R number to remain at 1.3, we could quickly lose control of the situation. Calculations by the Directorate of Health indicate that if the infection continues to spread at the current rate, by the end of May, in 75 days, we could have 50 times as many daily cases as we have now. Long before we get that far, the municipal infection tracing systems will have collapsed, and hospitals will be hard-pressed to provide medical care to all those who need it.  The Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health have advised us to monitor the situation from day to day over the next couple of weeks to see if the relatively strict national measures kept in place since January, combined with tighter local restrictions in areas where infection levels are high, are enough to bring the numbers down again. If they are not, the Government is ready to introduce tighter national restrictions at short notice. In order to prepare the country for this, we have asked the Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health to propose what these should be. The proposed measures are:  If these measures are still not enough to suppress the spread of the new virus variants, the Government will consider reintroducing the recommendations that were in place in January, including the recommendation not to visit other people in their homes for a two-week period, to postpone all events, to maintain the red level in the traffic light model for secondary and upper secondary schools, and to provide online tuition at universities, university colleges and vocational technical colleges.  Although we are not introducing new national measures today, I would like to remind you all of the recommendations currently in place. Everyone across the country must limit social contact. If you meet someone outside your household, you should do so outdoors. Do not travel abroad. Non-essential travel within Norway should be avoided. Anyone who is able to should work from home. Events that bring together people from more than one municipality should be cancelled or postponed.  If everyone follows these recommendations, this should be enough to keep the infection levels down. We also recommend that people who are infected and do not have an appropriate place to self-isolate should contact the municipality. A hotel could be a good option in such cases. The Government will announce specific recommendations for the Easter break in due course. How strict these will be will depend on how the infection situation develops over the next days and weeks.  But already now, we would like to urge Norwegians living abroad not to come home for Easter this year. This also applies to students.  We also urge Norwegians and people living in Norway not to travel abroad at Easter. Anyone who chooses to do so should be aware that the Government is now considering extending the hotel quarantine scheme to new groups. This means that if you take a holiday trip abroad now, you will probably have to undergo quarantine at a hotel on your return. The Government’s advice to avoid non-essential travel to all countries currently applies until 15 April. We will also consider making it a statutory requirement that all people must have a separate bedroom and bathroom while undergoing quarantine, and that it must be possible to keep two metres away from other members of the household. This means that fines may be imposed if a place of quarantine does not comply with the designated requirements.  We also recommend that universities and university colleges plan to have online tuition the first week after Easter.  Infection levels rising among children and young people Madam President, The Government is giving priority to children and young people. This means that we will do all we can to minimise the impact of measures on children and young people. Our aim is to ensure that children experience as normal a day in school and at day-care as possible. At the same time, we must ensure that infection control measures are adapted to combat the new variants of the virus. This is no easy task, but it is necessary all the same. Limiting restrictive measures in order to minimise the impact on children and young people also has negative consequences. There have been more confirmed cases among children and young people recently, and many outbreaks in schools and day-care centres. This is worrying. The rise in infection levels among children and young people means that we have to introduce tighter restrictions that also affect others. But in the Government’s view, it is the right approach to protect children and young people from the impacts of the restrictions as far as possible. In Norway, unlike in many other countries, we have largely managed to keep schools and day-care centres open since spring last year. We have managed to do so partly because we have established a multi-level system of measures for schools and day-care centres.  We have received feedback from many schools and day-care centres requesting that these guidelines are updated now in light of the emergence of the new variants of the virus in Norway. We have also received indications that there has been varying compliance with the measures that are currently in place and that the current measures pose certain practical challenges. In some areas, for example in Oslo, schools have had to revert to the red level in the traffic light model after a very short space of time. There is therefore good reason to review whether the model in place is adapted well enough to the new more infectious strains of the virus and the actual situation in schools and day-care centres. We are now are taking a number of steps to ensure both adequate infection control and maximum attendance in schools and day-care centres. To achieve this, we must work together with the local authorities. We must involve the local authorities in what we are doing. First, we have tasked the national Directorate of Health, Institute of Public Health and Directorate for Education and Training with reviewing the infection control guidelines. This work has already begun, and is being carried out in consultation with municipalities and relevant stakeholders. Second, this week we will send letters to municipalities, counties and other day-care centre and school owners regarding measures designed to enable children and young people to be physically at school more often. Third, we are repeating our assurance that municipalities will receive compensation for additional costs associated with infection control and with any measures they implement to ensure compliance with infection control rules and enable as many pupils as possible to receive tuition in the classroom. We also emphasise that it is the responsibility of the municipalities to ensure that funds reach the individual schools and day-care centres, in order to safeguard the situation of pupils and staff alike.  With good guidelines and a well-defined multi-level system of restrictions in place, we can improve infection control and at the same time ensure maximum attendance in schools and day-care centres while limiting the impacts of restrictive measures on children and young people. Extension of entry restrictions, the safety valve/daily commuters from Sweden Madam President, Restrictions on entry to Norway have been an important part of the Government’s response to the pandemic since March 2020. Norway is one of the countries in Europe that has maintained the strictest entry restrictions and quarantine rules throughout the pandemic. When the UK announced the discovery of a mutated variant of the virus, the Government quickly introduced special rules on entry and testing for people arriving in Norway from there. In addition, at the end of January, the Government also significantly tightened entry rules for foreign nationals. Now, as a general rule, only foreign nationals who are resident in Norway are permitted to enter the country. However, there are exemptions in place for certain groups who are regarded as having particularly close ties to Norway or whose purpose for visiting Norway is especially important, such as non-Norwegians who have close family members here or who are key workers or transport sector workers, and health personnel who are coming to Norway from Sweden and Finland.  The duration and specific details of the entry restrictions are assessed on an ongoing basis in line with developments in the COVID-19 situation, and are considered against alternative, less stringent measures. It is important to ensure that the restrictions do not remain in place longer than is necessary.  The strict entry rules that were introduced on 29 January were required in order to reduce the risk of infections being brought into Norway from abroad. These restrictions have been effective in limiting the number of imported infections. The number is now low, but infection levels in Norway are still rising.  At the same time, the restrictions have created a very difficult situation for people who work in Norway but live in other countries. They have not been able to go to work and have therefore lost their incomes.  As of Monday 1 March, we have eased the restrictions somewhat by allowing daily commuters from Sweden and Finland to travel to work in Norway again, under a strict testing and control regime.  However, the ban on entry to Norway continues to affect many people, and now it appears that these entry restrictions will remain in place for some time. Many of these people are entitled to benefits under the National Insurance Scheme. In the light of this, the Government is proposing the establishment of a new scheme to provide income security for those who are affected. The Government is proposing a new compensation scheme based on the existing sickness benefit scheme. This will make it possible to put the scheme in place relatively quickly. The benefit will cover 70 % of the income of those who are eligible (that is the income calculated by NAV as a basis for paying sickness benefits), which is about the same level of compensation the workers would receive if they were temporarily laid off and covered by the furlough rules.  Under the Government’s proposal, the employer would be responsible for disbursing the benefit and for obtaining a refund of the full amount from NAV afterwards. The new scheme is to be effective from 29 January when the ban on entry to Norway was introduced and will last as long as the strict entry rules continue to apply to workers. The Government will soon present more details about the scheme and its proposed legal basis to the Storting.  The entry restrictions have major consequences for Norwegian enterprises that are dependent on foreign workers, and thus may affect the development of the Norwegian economy. These impacts are likely to be more significant if the entry restrictions remain in place for a long time.  On 20 February, the Government therefore introduced an application-based scheme under which companies may seek permission to enter Norway for essential foreign workers not already covered by one of the other exemptions. The scheme will not make it possible for businesses to meet all their needs for regular labour. The risks involved in allowing too many people to enter the country are too great.  In the first instance, the scheme will apply to a limited group of workers who are considered essential to maintain business operations. These are workers with technical skills who carry out tasks relating to the operation of machinery and technical equipment and who are employed by, or under contract to, the company that submits the application.  The scheme is administered by the Norwegian Maritime Authority, and we greatly appreciate their willingness to take on this entirely new task. As of 5 March, just over 1 000 applications had been processed under the scheme, and around 500 workers have been granted permission to enter Norway. The Government is now considering expanding the scheme to encompass other groups of workers, following a comprehensive assessment of the infection situation and the business sector’s needs. Vaccines Madam President, The Government’s main priority when it comes to the vaccination programme is to vaccinate the entire population quickly. Because of the limited availability of vaccines in the initial phase, we have given priority to residents of nursing homes and the most elderly people, who are at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19. It is incorrect to say that Norway is lagging behind other European countries when it comes to vaccination. As you know, we are participating in the EU joint vaccines strategy, and we are allocated doses according to the same distribution key as other European countries.  Right now, the figures show that Norway is one of the countries in Europe that has administered the most vaccines based on the number of allocated doses. People in the 75-84 age group and health personnel are now being vaccinated. We have administered over 600 000 doses. The Institute of Public Health has recommended a modest geographical redistribution of vaccines to the City of Oslo, and the municipalities of Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg, Moss and Lørenskog. Oslo is to give priority to the districts of Stovner, Alna, Grorud, Bjerke, Søndre Nordstrand and Gamle Oslo which have seen the highest rates of infection over an extended period of time. A number of additional changes are being made that will have a far greater impact on the distribution and speed of the vaccine rollout in the municipalities. Firstly, the Institute of Public Health has now decided that the vaccines will be distributed according to the number of people in a municipality over 18 years of age, rather than on the basis of the number of inhabitants over the age of 65, as has been the case until now. This means that municipalities with younger populations will receive more vaccines. Secondly, the AstraZeneca vaccine will now also be recommended for people over 65. This decision has been taken on the basis of new information about its efficacy. It means that many people in the top priority groups can be vaccinated two to five weeks earlier than anticipated. Based on input from the Institute of Public Health, the Government has decided that the interval between the first and second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can be extended from three to six weeks. The Institute will reach a final conclusion on the matter shortly. It will also consider whether the interval can be extended beyond six weeks. This would make it possible to give more people the first dose earlier. What is most important is that vaccines are now becoming more widely available. We are currently receiving around 100 000 vaccine doses a week. We expect to be receiving twice this amount by the end of March. And the size of the shipments will increase further in April, May and June.  We therefore expect to see a significant rise in the number of vaccines administered over the next few months. This is cause for hope. It is likely that new vaccines will be coming too.  The Norwegian Medicines Agency started the approval process for the CureVac and Novavax vaccines in February. The Janssen vaccine could be approved on 11 March. This is a single-dose vaccine that will help to further accelerate the pace of the vaccine rollout. At present, we are expecting all adults to have been offered a vaccine by or in the course of the summer. A few European countries are impatient and are unilaterally seeking to obtain more vaccines that can provide protection against new variants of the virus now and in the time ahead. All the approved vaccines that are currently available are being used and it is therefore not possible to obtain more doses at short notice. Norway is working with other countries to build preparedness in the event that existing vaccines cease to be effective against new strains of the virus. That is why we are now entering into agreements with the EU on future deliveries of vaccines that can be adapted to combat new mutations. We have also provided NOK 200 million in funding to support the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop vaccines against future mutations of the virus.  Compensation schemes Madam President, Since March last year, we have made it clear that we will keep financial measures in place for as long as we have infection control measures, and that these will be adapted to the infection situation and the level of restrictions. Just two weeks ago, the Storting discussed proposals from the Government to extend and adjust a number of the support schemes established in response to the pandemic. The proposals were put forward against the backdrop of rising infection levels and uncertainty about how the situation will unfold. Our companies can be secure in the knowledge that, as long as they have been directly or indirectly required by us to close down activities, we will have schemes in place to compensate them and prevent unnecessary bankruptcies. A comprehensive set of financial measures has been put in place to support the business sector. The broad-based compensation scheme for the business sector has been extended until the end of June. So far, nearly NOK 9 billion has been provided through this scheme to around 34 000 companies. Over NOK 11 billion has been disbursed, primarily to small and medium-sized enterprises, under the loan guarantee scheme A scheme has also been established that enables municipalities to provide support adapted to local needs, for example to hard-hit businesses in the tourism sector or restaurants. NOK 1.8 billion has now been allocated to this scheme.  A number of the financial COVID-19 measures have been designed in such a way that the amount of support automatically increases when activity in the economy declines. If the situation deteriorates over the next weeks and months, support to the businesses that are affected will therefore increase. On Friday, we presented a proposal for a new salary support scheme, in response to a request made by the Storting. The scheme has been developed in cooperation with the other social partners. It is also in line with the Government’s COVID-19 exit strategy – produce more and include more people in working life. ­­  Under the scheme, support will be provided to businesses that have been affected by restrictions for a long time and have had to temporarily lay off staff, those that have seen a dramatic drop in turnover and will need time to get their operations up and running again.  The scheme will make it possible for companies to bring back furloughed employees to prepare to resume activities, even though revenues are still down. In this way, companies will be ready to deliver their goods and services as soon as their customers return. For some businesses, this may provide a good opportunity to bring back furloughed staff for training and development purposes pending an increase in activities.  Overall, we have in place a comprehensive package of financial measures that provides support to a wide range of businesses. The Government will do all it can to enable us to come out of the crisis in as strong a position as possible. As we near the end of the pandemic, we will need to turn our attention towards promoting activity and restructuring. Then, the most important steps we can take to support growth in the private sector will be to reopen society and discontinue the public support schemes. The Government will present a renewed assessment of the details of the financial measures in connection with the revised national budget for 2021. The way forward – at the end of March, we will present a plan for the period leading up to summer In the time ahead, we must be prepared for both good news and bad news as a result of uncertainty surrounding the delivery of vaccines and the spread of new strains of coronavirus. Our overall response and the set of measures used at local, regional and national levels will have to be adjusted on an ongoing basis depending on how the pandemic develops in Norway. In this work, the Government will give priority first to children and young people, and then to safeguarding jobs. If we manage to keep the R number below 1 in March and April, we will be able to take the first steps towards a return to normality in May.  Basic recommendations such as keeping your hands clean, staying at home if you are ill, keeping your distance from other people, and quarantine and self-isolation rules will probably have to remain in place for a long time. All measures will have to be adapted and considered on the basis of an overall assessment of their positive and negative impacts. Infection control measures must be balanced and sufficiently stringent to have the required effect, but they must not be more restrictive on people or enterprises than is necessary, nor should they remain in place any longer than they are needed. Achieving this will become even more important as the pandemic nears its end. If possible, measures should be local rather than national, and the burden of the measures should be as low as possible. At the same time, it is vital that we manage to keep the pandemic under control in Norway.  The Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health are working on a plan for a gradual reduction of the restrictions. The Government will return to this issue in the second half of March.  Conclusion Madam President, I requested the opportunity to hold this address because I wanted to update Storting on the status quo.  The situation is uncertain. Over the past few weeks, we have seen a surge in cases of the mutated virus and an increase in hospital admissions. This is a serious development. It is clear that we have another uphill climb ahead. But if we can scale this peak too, our goal of a return to normality will be within reach.  If we manage to keep the spread of infection under control in March and April, we will be able to start opening up again in May. Many municipalities have now introduced strict local measures. We do not know yet what the effect of these will be. That is why it is too early to impose stricter national measures now. Instead, we are further strengthening the framework for local measures. Our aim is to suppress local outbreaks more quickly and more decisively. If we succeed, there will be no need for new national measures. If we do not succeed, we will have to tighten the restrictions swiftly. I have outlined the measures that will be introduced in that case, and I ask everyone in the country to be prepared for this. Whether we end up needing local or national measures, I am asking everyone today to make this final push. To climb this hill together. In the hope that this is truly the last one and that this time we will finally reach the top.

"19"," White House Global COVID-19 Summit ",2021-09-22,"This is unacceptable. We need to act now. Together, we must ensure global access.  Together, we must strengthen the WHO. Together, we must fully finance ACT-A. Norway has contributed its fair share. Others should do the same. We must establish sustainable financing mechanisms to ensure global health security. At national and global levels. I commend President Biden taking this initiative. You can count on Norway’s support. Now we must ensure inclusive and effective implementation. We should do this collectively. Secretary General Guterres has set out good multilateral solutions in the report “Our Common Agenda”. At this summit, we commit to combat this pandemic. And to prepare for the next one. In other words, let’s finish the work we have started, and do what is needed to be better prepared for the future.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/white-house-global-covid-19-summit/id2872300/"
"20"," Introduction by the prime minister at Covid-19 press conference ",2021-02-19,"Good afternoon everybody, Several weeks of strict infection prevention measures are now behind us. Infections fell in January. Since then, the curve has flattened.We now see signs that infections may be on the rise again. Different groups want us to adjust the measures to suit them. And there are many with good arguments in favour of doing so. However, the outcome of all these wishes will be an increase in infections. Let me take this opportunity to share a quotation with you that I have used on many previous occasions, but which also applies to this situation. As the late Prime Minister Jan P. Syse said: ‘We are against the sum of everything that we are in favour of’. The sum of opening up too much is that infections will also increase too much. The sum of best intentions will lead to us losing control.We all want to see measures eased. But there remains great uncertainty.The infection situation is too unstable. This uncertainty relates primarily to the new strains of the virus.During the course of the last week, we have significantly eased the measures in place in the capital region. As of 22 February, we will be removing the regional measures in place in Western Norway. This has been agreed in dialogue with the municipalities in that region and due to an improvement in the infection situation. Although some municipalities may introduce local measures, the easing of measures as a whole will result in increased activity and people meeting more frequently. Together with an unstable infection situation, this is why the government has decided to extend the vast majority of the national measures in place.  Among other things, this means that everyone should continue to limit their social contacts. Visits should still be confined to five guests in addition to those people who already live together. It is too risky for us to significantly ease other restrictions at present. Furthermore, we do not have enough experience of the new strains of the virus. So we will carry out a new assessment of the measures in mid-March. Although the majority of the measures in place will continue, we are making some changes. These changes will apply from 00:01 on Tuesday 23 February.The most important changes are in line with the government’s strategy. Children and young people are being prioritised. Many children and young people have been struggling for a long time.They have little in the way of activities or social contact. I am therefore pleased to announce that we are cautiously re-opening certain areas for them. I must remind you that these are the national rules and guidelines that I am referring to. Your local municipality may have stricter rules in place if the prevailing infection situation dictates that this is necessary. Everyone must come from the same municipality. For example, this means that a football or handball team is permitted to play against other teams in the same municipality. The usual rules applicable to events will still apply, so there can still only be a limited number of people present, but there will be slightly greater opportunities during the final few weeks of the season. In addition to re-opening areas of junior sports, we are also easing some measures applicable to students. Guri will tell you more about that. However, as we ease measures in some areas we must tighten restrictions in others in order to avoid a situation in which the virus spreads too much. This will almost certainly seem unreasonable to some. However, it is the sum of everything we do that is crucial in determining how much infection we have in society. As some people benefit from slightly more activities, we must reduce the burden elsewhere. Following advice from the health authorities, we are therefore bringing forward the cut-off time for the serving of alcohol from midnight to 10pm. This is a tightening of the existing rules. This will enable some easing of measures elsewhere, for instance in terms of our children and young people.We must retain good control of our borders.We are therefore making some changes. The rules applicable to quarantine upon arrival and quarantine hotels will be tightened. Kjell Ingolf will discuss this in further detail.At the same time, we are going to allow a limited number of the most important personnel to come to Norway to work.We are launched an application-based scheme for businesses who need to bring in people to work. This will guarantee that employees who are strictly necessary for ensuring activities continue in Norwegian workplaces are able to enter the country. We will be allowing technical personnel who carry out duties that are necessary in relation to dealing with technical equipment to enter. One example of this would be an expert required to repair advanced machinery where the expertise to do so is not available in Norway.The scheme will not resolve the need for personnel to fulfil ordinary duties in industry. The risk of opening the borders to too many people at present is too great.However, the scheme will help to ensure that businesses are able to bring in foreign personnel who are crucial to ensuring operations do not grind to a halt, and that Norwegian employees will still be able to go to work.In the event of local outbreaks, the general rule is now that these will be handled at a municipal level. However, there may be situations where municipalities petition the government to quickly implement common measures in their region. This was the case when there was an outbreak in Nordre Follo.The government is now simplifying the rules that we apply when municipalities request national measures in their region. I must apologise that I am depriving many of the chance to lampoon us in their newspaper columns, but we will no longer be using the ‘ring 1’ and ‘ring 2’ designations, and we will also be tidying up the packages of measures at our disposal.There will now be three levels of measures that can be implemented at a national level. The approaches will remain the same as before. The more serious the outbreak, the higher the level of measures deployed.However, I promise you that there will still likely be something to poke fun at in future. Everything isn’t perfect right now. But it is a little bit more straightforward. Dealing with a pandemic is complicated. There is a lot we have to put in place in a short space of time, but we are doing our best to make it understandable and realisable. All with one aim in mind: to keep infections down. Уважаемые дамы и господа! У нас осталось позади несколько недель применения строгих мер инфекционного контроля. В январе количество заражённых сильно снизилось. С тех пор кривая заражений выровнялась. Cейчас снова появились признаки роста заболеваемости. Различные группы хотят, чтобы мы ослабили меры по борьбе с инфекцией именно для них. И у многих есть на то веские аргументы. Однако сумма всех этих намерений приведёт к росту количества зараженных. Воспользуюсь поводом привести одну цитату, которую я уже приводила много раз раньше, но которая применима и в настоящей ситуации, - это слова Яна П. Сюсе: «Мы против суммы всего того, что мы поддерживаем». Сумма слишком сильных послаблений значит, что уровень распространения инфекции значительно вырастет. Сумма добрых намерений приведёт к потере контроля. Мы все хотим послабления мер. Но пока ситуация слишком неопределённая, а эпидемиологическая ситуация слишком нестабильна. Неопределённость в первую очередь связана с новыми видами вируса. За последнюю неделю мы значительно ослабили меры по борьбе с инфекцией в Восточной Норвегии Эстланде. С 22 февраля включительно мы приостанавливаем действие региональных мер в западных муниципалитетах. Это было сделано в диалоге с муниципалитетами, а также в связи с улучшением эпидемиологической ситуации. Несмотря на то, что некоторые муниципалитеты вводят местные меры, общее послабление в сумме приведёт к повышению активности, и жители смогут чаще встречаться друг с другом. На фоне нестабильной инфекционной ситуации правительство решило продлить большинство национальных мер. Среди прочего это значит, что каждый должен продолжать ограничивать свои социальные контакты. Посещая друг друга необходимо по-прежнему ограничиваться пятью гостями в дополнение к хозяевам, проживающим вместе. В данное время слишком рискованно сильно ослаблять остальные меры. На это у нас также отсутствует достаточный опыт борьбы с новыми вариантами вирусов. Поэтому мы в середине марта сделаем новую оценку используемых мер. Несмотря на то, что большая часть мер остаётся в силе, мы вносим некоторые изменения. Эти изменения вступят в силу в полночь с понедельника на вторник 23 февраля. Наиболее важные изменения соответствуют стратегии правительства. Приоритет отдаётся детям и молодежи. Многие дети и подростки уже давно переживают трудные времена. Мало проводится досуговых мероприятий, и ограничено общение. Поэтому я рада, что сейчас мы можем осторожно ввести послабления. Напоминаю о том, что это национальные советы и правила. В вашем местном муниципалитете могут действовать более строгие правила, если того требует местная инфекционная ситуация. Помимо послаблений в детском спорте мы также вводим послабления для студентов. Гури Мельбю расскажет об этом поподробнее. Дело в том, что, когда мы вводим послабления в одних сферах, мы вынуждены вводить ограничения в других сферах - в целях избежания сильного роста короновирусной инфекции. Некоторые наверняка сочтут это несправедливым, но именно сумма всех видов деятельности играет решающую роль для уровня инфекции в обществе. Когда в каких-то направлениях активность повышается, нагрузку в других направлениях необходимо снижать. Поэтому по рекомендации органов здравоохранения мы сдвигаем часы запрета на сервировку алкоголя с полуночи до 22:00. Это является ужесточением ограничения, но это позволит ввести послабления в других сферах, например в отношении детей и молодёжи. Нам необходимо тщательно контролировать наши границы. Поэтому мы вносим некоторые изменения. Ужесточаются правила по соблюдению карантина при въезде в страну, а также порядки в отношении карантинных отелей. Кьелль Инголф Ропстад расскажет об этом подробнее. В то же время мы открываем право въезда для ограниченного количества лиц - представителей самых востребованных профессий, приезжающих сюда работать. Мы создадим порядок, при котором компании, нуждающиеся в привлечении работников, смогут подавать ходатайства на получение такого права. Порядок обеспечит возможность въезда для сотрудников, необходимых для поддержания деятельности на норвежских рабочих местах. Мы допускаем въезд технического персонала, выполняющего работу, строго необходимую для эксплуатации технического оборудования. Таким лицом может например являться специалист, способный отремонтировать высокотехнологичное оборудование, при отсутствии экспертизы в Норвегии. Такой порядок и послабление не решит потребности бизнеса в людях для выполнения обычных трудовых задач. Риск послабления в отношении большого количества людей сейчас слишком велик. Но этот порядок сможет помочь компаниям привлечь иностранный персонал, критически важный для обеспечения непрерывности работы, а также для возможности норвежских работников оставаться при своей занятости. При возникновении местных вспышек, главный принцип такой, что с ними должны бороться муниципалитеты. Но могут снова возникнуть ситуации, когда муниципалитеты попросят правительство оперативно принять общие меры для региона, как мы например видели при вспышке инфекции в Нурдре Фолло. В настоящее время правительство упрощает правила, используемые в тех случаях, когда муниципалитеты нуждаются в принятии национальных мер в своём регионе. Мне жаль, что я сейчас лишаю многих комментаторов в прессе возможности сострить, но мы больше не будем использовать понятия «зоны первого и второго кольца», и мы наведём порядок в различных уровнях мер инфекционного контроля. Теперь будет три уровня мер, которые можно будет принять на национальном уровне. Процедуры останутся такими как раньше. Чем серьезнее вспышка, тем выше уровень мер. Но я вам обещаю вам, что в будущем, наверное, тоже будут возможности над чем-то подтрунить. И сейчас не всё будет идеально. Но будет немного проще. С пандемией бороться сложно. В сжатые сроки нужно решать многие вопросы, но мы стремимся сделать всё, что в наших силах, чтобы сделать это понятным и осуществимым, с единственной целью: подавить коронавирусную инфекцию. Waan salaamay dhammaantiin Waxaynu hadda ka soo baxday dhowr usbuuc oo ay jireen talaabooyinka ka hortag faafitaan oo adag. Janaayo waxa si weyn hoos ugu dhacay faafitaankii. Wixii ka dambeeyeyna waxa istaagay kor u socodkii faafitaanka. Waxa hadda la arkaa in faafitaanku markale soo kordhayo. Qaybo kala duwan oo bulshada ka mid ah ayaa raba in iyaga laga debciyo talaabooyinka. In badan oo ka mid ah waa loo garaabi karaa. Laakiin oggolaanshaha codsiyadaas oo dhan waxa ka imanaya in faafitaanku kor u kaco. Waxan halkan ku soo qaadanayaa hadal aan marar badan oo hore isticmaalay, oo xaaladana ku haboon, taasoo ah hadalkii Jan O. Syse:  «Waynu ka soo horjeednaa natiijada guud ee ka dhalanaysa dhammaan waxyaalaha aynu rabno». Natiijada debcinta badani waxay noqonaysa in faafitaanku kordho. Natiijada waxyaalaha wacan ee la rabo waxay noqonaysaa in xaaladu faraha ka baxdo. Qof kasta wuu rabaa in la debciyo talaabooyinka. Laakiin weli walaac weyn ayaa jira. Xaaladda faafitaanku ma saldhigan. Waxa walaaca ugu weyn keenay noocyada cusub ee fayrusta. Usbuucii u dambeeyey waxannu si weyn u debcinay talaabooyinka aaga Gobollada Bari. Laga bilaabo 22-ka febraayo waxannu joojin doonaa talaabooyinka heerka gobolka ah ee degmooyinka galbeedka. Waxa arrintaas lagala tashaday degmooyinka isla markaana waxa soo roonaaday xaaladda faafitaanka. Inkastoo degmooyinka qaarkood soo rogaan talaabooyin maxali ah, haddana isugeynta debcinta talaabooyinka ayaa keeni doona dhaqdhaqaaqu kordho iyo in dadku u kulmaan in ka badan sidii hore. Arrintaas oo lagu daray xaaladda faafitaanka ee aan weli saldhigan, ayaa sabab u ah in dawladdu go’aamisay in la sii wado badanaa talaabooyinkii qaran. Taas oo macanheedu tahay in ay wacan yahay in dadku weli yareeyaan isla kulanka. Booqashada waxa lagu koobayaa shan marti ah oo soo booqan kara dadka guriga degan. Xaaladda ayaa sii xumaan karta haddii hadda talaabooyin kale aad loo debciyo. Mana lihin waayo-aragnimo inagu filan oo ku saabsan noocyada fayrusta ee cusub oo loo cuskan karo arrintaas. Dib u eegis ayaa lagu samayn doonaa talaabooyinka marka la soo gaadho bisha maars. Inkastoo la si wadi doona badanaa taloobooyinka, waxannu samayn doonaa wax-ka-beddello. Wax-ka-beddeladaasi waxay ka bilaabmayaan saacada 00.00, habeenka salaasada 23-ka febraayo. Wax-ka-beddellada ugu muhiimsan waxay waafaaqsan yihiin istaraatijiyada dawladda. Carruurta iyo dhallinyarada ayaa la siinaya mudnaanta. Carruur iyo dhallinyaro badan ayaa muddo dheer ku jirtay xaalad adag. Waxa yaraa fursadaha firfircoonida iyo la kulanka dadka. Taas darteed waan ku faraxsanahay in hadda la samaynayo debcin taxadar leh. Waxan idin xasuusinayaa in hadda laga hadlayo talooyinka iyo xeerarka heer qaran ah. Degmadaadu waxay soo rogi kartaa xeerar intan sii adag haddii xalaada faafitaanka ee degmadu sidaas dhigayso. Waa in dadkaas oo dhan ka wada tirsan yihiin hal degmo. Tusaale ahaan kooxo kubadda-cagta ama kubadda-gacanta ah waxay la ciyaari karaan kooxo kale oo ay isla degmo ka tirsan yihiin. Xeerarka caadiga ah ee ku saabsan qabanqaabooyinka ayaa jira, markaa weli tirada goob-joogeyaashu way xadidan tahay, laakiin xoogaa debcin ah ayaa la sameeyey hadda oo lagu jiro usbuucyadii u dambeeyey ciyaar-sannadeedka. Marka laga tago debcinta ciyaaraha carruurta, waxannu fududayn u samayn doonaa ardayda waxbarashada sare. Wasiir Guri ayaa sii faahfaahin doonta. Laakiin marka aannu meelo debcino, waxannu ku qasban nahay, si faafitaanku u sii badan, in la sii giijiyo meelo kale. Marka dad loo fasaxo firfircooni dheeraad ah, waa in meelo kale laga yareeyo. Kolay dadka qaar ayaa dareemi doona in aanay macquul ahayn. Laakiin isugeynta waxyaalaha aynu samayno ayaa macno u leh sida faafitaanka ka dhex jira bulshada noqon doono. Kadib markii hay’addaha caafimaadku ku taliyeen, waxa waqtigii joojinta shubista aalkahoolka laga beddelayaa saacadda 00.00 oo waxa laga dhigayaa 22.00. Waa sii giijin. Arrintaasi waxay suurtagal ka dhigaysaa in meelo kale la debciyo, tusaale ahaan arrimaha carruurta iyo dhallinyarada. Waa in aynu si wacan ula socono xuduudaha waddankeena. Taas darteed wax-ka-beddelo ayaa la samaynayaa. Xeerarka karantiimada soo gelitaanka waddanka iyo karantiimada hoteellada ayaa la sii adkaynayaa. Kjell Ingolf ayaa faahfaahin doona. Isla markaana waxa la banaynayaa in tiro kooban oo ka mid ah shaqaalaha ugu muhiimsan iman karaan waddanka si ay u shaqeeyaan. Waxa la samaynayaa nidaam ku salaysan codsi oo shirkaduhu isticmaali karaan marka ay rabaan in ay keenaan shaqaale. Nidaamkaasi wuxu ilaalinaya in ay iman karaan shaqaalaha lagama maarmaanka u ah sii wadida hawlaha shaqo ee goobaha shaqada ee Noorway. Waxa la oggolaanayaa shaqaalaha farsamada qalabka ee qabta hawlo looga maarmi karin oo ah maaraynta qalabka. Tusaale ahaan qof khabiir ku ah dayactirka mashiin casri ah iyadoo aan aqoontaas laga helayn Noorway. Nidaamkan iyo banayntani ma xalin doonaan baahida shirkaduhu u qabaan inay keenaan dad qaban kara hawlaha caadiga ah. Khasaaraha ka iman kara debcinta ayaa xilligan ah mid weyn. Laakiin nidaamkani wuxu keenayaa in shirkaduhu dibedda ka keensan karaan shaqaale muhiim u ah sii socodka hawlaha si ay markaas shaqaalaha Noorway degan u haysan karaan shaqooyinkooda. Haddii fayrus ka dilaacdo meel, caadi ahaan degmooyinka ayaa ka masuul ah in ay wax ka qabtaan. Laakiin waxa iman kara xaalado ay degmooyinku rabaan in dawladdu si degdeg ah u soo rogto talaabooyin ka dhexeeya degmooyinka. Tusaale ahaan sidii la sameeyey markii fayrustu ka dilaacday Nordre Follo. Dawladdu waxay hadda fududaynaysaa nidaamka xeerarka la isticmaalayo marka degmooyinku codsadaan in talaabooyin qaran lagu soo rogo gobolkooda. Waan ka xumahay in aan hadda dad badan ka tirtiro qodobo gar ah oo ay ku qori lahaayeen faalooyinkooda, laakiin waannu joojin doonnaa isticmaalka ""wareeg 1"" iyo ""wareeg 2"", isla markaana waxa dib loo hagaajinayaa heerarka talaabooyinka. Waxa hadda talaabooyinka laga dhigayaa saddex heer oo si heer qaran ah loo go’aamin karo. Marka kasta oo xaaladu sii darnaato, waxa kor loo qaadayaa heerka talaabooyinka. Laakiin waxan idin balanqaadi karaa in waqtiga soo socdana la heli doono waxyaalo la dacaayadeeyo. Xataa hadda wax kasta ma noqon doonaan sida ugu wacan. Laakiin in yar ayey ka fududaan doontaa sidii hore. In safmar la maareeyo maaha wax fudud. Waxyaalo badan ayaa la rabaa in lagu diyaariyo waqti kooban, laakiin waxannu ku dedaalnay in laga dhigo wax dadku fahmi karo oo la fulin karo. Iyadoo hal ujeedo laga leeyahay: In la yareeyo faafitaanka.   Mamy za sobą wiele tygodni surowych działań zapobiegania zakażeniu. W styczniu zakażenie zmniejszyło się. Od tego czasu ilość zakażeń poszła bardzo w dół. Po tym skala wyprostowała się. Teraz ponownie widzimy oznaki tego, że zakażenie się zwiększa. Różne grupy proszą o złagodzenie działań właśnie dla nich. I mają na to dobre argumenty. Jednak suma tych wszystkich próśb doprowadzi do zwiększenia zakażenia. Pozwolę sobie wykorzystać tę okazję na cytat używany przeze mnie wcześniej przy wielu okazjach, ale dotyczy to również i tej sytuacji, a mianowicie cytat Jana P. Syse: „Jesteśmy przeciwko wszystkiemu za czym jesteśmy”. Suma zbyt dużego otwarcia oznacza również to, że zakażenie dużo wzrośnie. Suma dobrych próśb doprowadzi do tego, że stracimy kontrolę. Wszyscy chcemy złagodzeń. Ale w dalszym ciągu jest dużo niepewności. Niestabilna jest sytuacja zakażeń. Niepewność ta dotyczy przede wszystkim nowych wariantów wirusa. W przeciągu ostatniego tygodnia złagodziliśmy znacznie działania na Ostlandet (Norwegii Wschodniej). Od 22-ego lutego włącznie zakończymy działania regionalne dla gmin Norwegii Zachodniej. Zostało to uzgodnione w porozumieniu z gminami, ponieważ sytuacja zakażenia uległa tam poprawie. Chociaż pojedyncze gminy wprowadzają działania miejscowe, to złagodzenie w sumie doprowadzi do zwiększonej aktywności i ludzie częściej się będą spotykać. Wraz z niestabilną sytuacją zakażeń jest to przyczyną tego, że rząd zadecydował o kontynuacji większości krajowych działań na poziomie krajowym. Oznacza to między innymi, że w dalszym ciągu wszyscy powinni ograniczyć kontakty towarzyskie. W dalszym ciągu należy ograniczyć wizyty do pięciu gości, w dodatku do domowników. Ryzykownym będzie teraz złagodzenie innych działań. Nie mamy na to wystarczająco dużo doświadczenia z nowymi wariantami wirusa. Rozważymy więc ponownie działania w połowie marca. Chociaż będzie kontynuowana większość działań, dokonamy pewnych zmian. Zmiany te będą ważne od północy, w noc z poniedziałku na wtorek 23-ego lutego. Te najważniejsze zmiany zgodne są za strategią rządu. Dzieci i młodzież są priorytetem. Duża grupa dzieci i młodzieży miała długo trudny okres. Mało zajęć i mało kontaktu towarzyskiego. Jestem dlatego rada, że teraz mogę ostrożnie wprowadzić złagodzenie reżimu dla nich. Przypominam o tym, że są to rady i przepisy na poziomie krajowym. Jeżeli wymaga tego miejscowa sytuacja zakażeń, to Twoja miejscowa gmina może mieć surowsze działania. Wewnątrz na tych zawodach może być do 50 osób. Na zewnątrz granicą jest 200. Jest to włącznie z zawodnikami, rodzicami, trenerami i młodszym rodzeństwem. Wszyscy muszą być z tej samej gminy. To oznacza na przykład, że drużyna piłki nożnej lub piłki ręcznej może grać przeciwko drugiej drużynie z tej samej gminy. Ważne są w dalszym ciągu przepisy zwyczajne dla zawodów, więc w dalszym ciągu musi być ograniczona liczna osób obecnych, ale będą na to trochę większe możliwości teraz w te ostatnie tygodnie sezonu. Nie znaleźliśmy teraz na to miejsca. Mamy jednak porozumienie z działem sportu o tym, co powinno być priorytetem na przyszłość, gdy zaczniemy otwierać więcej. Oprócz otwarcia sportu dziecięcego, przeprowadzamy złagodzenia dla studentów. O tym powie Guri. Ale jest to tak, że jak przeprowadzamy złagodnienia w jednym miejscu, to oznacza to, że aby nie doprowadzić do rozpowszechnia się zakażenia, zaostrzamy w innych miejscach. Na pewno niektórzy odbierają to jako niesprawiedliwość. Ale jest to sumą wszystkiego co robimy, co decyduje o ilości zakażenia w społeczeństwie. Gdy niektórzy mogą teraz być trochę bardziej aktywni, to musimy obciążyć inne miejsca. Według rad Opieki Zdrowotnej zmieniamy czas zakończenia podawania alkoholu w lokalach z północy na godzinę 22. Jest to zaostrzenie. Umożliwia to złagodzenia w innych miejscach, na przykład dla dzieci i młodzieży. Musimy mieć dobrą kontrolę naszych granic. Dlatego też będą zmiany. Zostają zaostrzone przepisy związane z kwarantanną i hotelami kwarantannowymi. O tym powie Kjell Ingolf. Równocześnie otwieramy dla wjazdu ograniczonej ilości tych najważniejszych przyjeżdzających tu do pracy. Zostaje przyjęte rozwiązanie bazowane na wnioskowaniu dla przedsiębiorstw, potrzebujących przyjazdu personelu do pracy. Zabezpieczy to wjazd pracownikom wyjątkowo koniecznych dla potrzymania aktywności norweskich miejsc pracy. Otwieramy dla personelu technicznego wykonującego zadania wyjątkowo konieczne dla obsługi sprzętu technicznego. Przykładem tego jest ekspert reperujący zaawansowaną maszynę, gdzie nie ma takiej ekspertyzy w Norwegii. Rozwiązanie to i otwarcie nie zaspokoi potrzeby przedsiębiorstw w ludziach do wykonywania zwyczajnych zadań pracy. Ryzyko otwarcia dla zbyt wielu jest teraz zbyt duże. Ale rozwiązanie to dopomoże w tym, aby zakłady miały personel z zagranicy, który ma decydujące znaczenie dla tego, aby produkcja się nie zatrzymała i norwescy pracownicy w dalszym ciągu mieli swoje prace. Jeżeli dojdzie do miejscowych ognisk zakażenia, to główną regułą jest to, że będą sobie z tym radzić gminy. Ale może ponownie dojść do sytuacji, gdzie gminy poproszą o szybką reakcję rządu w związku z wspólnymi działaniami w danym regionie. Tak jak widzieliśmy to na przykład przy ognisku zakażenia w Nordre Follo. Rząd wprowadza teraz uproszczenia przepisów, używanych przez nas, gdy gminy proszą o krajowe działania w swoim regionie. Przykro mi, że odbieram wielu dobre argumenty do ich artykułów z komentarzami, ale nie będziemy już używać „pierścienia 1” i „pierścienia 2”, i uporządkujemy poziomy działań. Będą teraz trzy poziomy działań przyjmowanych na poziomie krajowym. Procedury będą takie same jak wcześniej. Im poważniejsze ognisko zakażeń, tym wyższy poziom działań. Ale obiecuję Wam, że na pewno będzie miejsce na zmianę czegoś również i w przyszłości. Teraz również nie będzie idealnie. Ale będzie trochę prościej. Skomplikowanym jest radzenie sobie z pandemią. Dużo musi być ułożone na miejsce w krótkim czasie, ale robimy wszystko tak jak możemy najlepiej, aby przeprowadzić to zrozumiale i wykonalnie. Z jednym celem: Aby było jak najmniej zakażeń.

"21"," The Prime Minister’s Opening Remarks at the Presentation of the Coronavirus Commission’s Report ",2021-04-16,"Dear everyone, First and foremost, I would like to thank the Commission for its report and efforts. I would also like to thank the secretariat for its work. This has been demanding work with complicated questions to answer and little time to solve the task.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had great consequences for all parts of Norwegian society. In that regard, this is a very different crisis from ones we have previously experienced. On 12 March, we introduced the most far-reaching measures Norway has ever had during peacetime. We made decisions under high levels of uncertainty. We put lives and health first and, together, we managed to suppress the virus and gain control over the spread. It is an important principle of emergency preparedness efforts that all events must be evaluated. All drills must be reviewed afterwards to see what we can learn from it. This is how we can develop our emergency preparedness and strengthen Norway’s security. Both our undertakings and we as a government have a duty to perform such evaluations. Even though Norway has suffered less than many other countries both economically and in terms of the rate of infection, it is important to evaluate and improve, because we have never previously experienced such an event on such a large scale and of such a long duration. In April 2020, the Government appointed an independent commission – we did this to get a thorough and complete examination and evaluation of the authorities’ management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commission’s mandate was to look at our emergency preparedness before the pandemic and how the crisis has been managed. What has worked well, and what could have been done better? What can we do differently next time? We must learn from this crisis, which is still ongoing, so that we can be better prepared for the next one. Since we are still in a pandemic, the Commission has not had the opportunity to evaluate every aspect of the authorities’ management. Consequently, it is the Norwegian Government’s wish that the Commission continue its work until the pandemic is over. I am happy to announce that nearly all the members of the Commission have agreed to continue in their task. This is important for continuity. The Coronavirus Commission’s report will now be presented for consultation with a deadline that will make it possible to review the report before summer. I would also like to ask the Storting for a chance to address the report in the coming weeks. Once the Commission has submitted its final report, the Norwegian Government will present the Storting with a white paper concerning the follow-up of the Commission’s work. Once again, I would like to thank the Commission for this important work, work that will form a basis for important discussions moving ahead and for how we can improve our emergency preparedness efforts and crisis management. I wish I could have presented you with flowers to thank you for your efforts but, since we are in the middle of a pandemic, the flowers will be sent to you and the other members of the Commission in a COVID-friendly way later. At least you know to expect them. I hereby present the Commission’s Chair, Professor Stener Kvinnsland.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/statsministerens-innledning-ved-overleveringen-av-koronakommisjonens-rapport/id2844632/"
"22"," Statement at the launch of the FACTI panel report ",2021-02-25,"Let me begin by congratulating the FACTI panel. I commend former President Grybauskaite and former Prime Minister Mayaki for steady leadership. I thank the panel members for their hard work. Under difficult circumstances you have given us an ambitious and forward-looking report. When the panel was launched, we were just entering a global pandemic. A year on, Covid-19 has deepened inequalities. It has been difficult to invest in sustainable development. Illicit financial flows have reinforced social and economic challenges. It is often said that “with crisis comes opportunity”. This is such a moment. We should use it to make the reforms needed to reach the sustainable development goals. This will take courage and willingness to act. The panel has engaged extensively with member states and stakeholders. The dialogue needs to continue. All stakeholders must act together to close the gaps that allow illicit financial flows to flourish. The FACTI panel addresses complex and technical issues. But the objective is clear and simple: Stopping the leak of trillions of dollars. And channeling more of these resources towards sustainable development. Illicit flows come in many forms. The result is always the same. It undermines governance, erodes trust and increases poverty. No one is immune from this global scourge. But developing countries are especially affected. This means less resources for health care, social protection and quality education. The report shows that many mechanisms do not prevent tax evasion, corruption, and illicit flows. There are gaps in implementation and enforcement. We need stronger standards around accountability, transparency and integrity. Corruption and financial crime should not go unpunished. Effective implementation of the UN Convention against corruption is key. We should also build on valuable work done in the OECD, the G20 and the IMF. I welcome recent steps to facilitate more country-by-country tax reporting. I am encouraged that more countries are improving transparency on beneficial ownership. However, many countries are still not participating in the standard-setting bodies. In order to ensure the legitimacy of tax norms and standards, we must frame and negotiate them in an inclusive manner. We all share a responsibility to prevent illicit flows from passing through our jurisdictions. A stronger global consensus on tax cooperation is an important step. If we invest in more robust international tax systems, we will receive a healthy and much needed return. Let us heed the call of the FACTI panel. Let us join the movement towards a financial system built on accountability, transparency and integrity. We need a global financial system that works for all and leaves no one behind. Thank you.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/statement-at-the-launch-of-the-facti-panel-report/id2836424/"
"23"," The Prime Minister’s address about the plan for reopening ",2021-04-07,"Madam President, Thank you for this opportunity to brief the Storting about the plan for the reopening of society and how we may return to a normal everyday life. The purpose of the reopening plan is to create better predictability. However, a lot is still unknown: How much will the virus spread during spring and summer? How fast will vaccines be supplied? How well do the vaccines prevent the spread of the virus? Will new mutations appear? Unfortunately, much uncertainty remains, which cannot be eliminated by a plan. Therefore, it is not possible to say with certainty when various parts of society may reopen. The process must be based upon the observed development of infection rates, hospital admissions, the capacity of the health care services, and the vaccination progress. The steps for the reopening of Norway must be based upon data, not dates. The plan presented by the Government today is based upon expert advice from the health authorities. We will not give any specific dates but will clarify which conditions must be met before opening up, and the order in which the various parts of society will reopen. This will provide some predictability, and the Government will follow this up along the way with supplemental information about how things are progressing. Therefore, the plan will become increasingly specific the closer we get to reopening. Plan for a gradual reopening of society Madam President, Last year the Government made a strategy for how to handle the pandemic. The overarching goals and priorities remain and will also apply to the reopening process. Our goal is still to retain control over the spread of the infection. In this way, we will safeguard the population’s health, reduce disruptions to society and protect our economy. When we are to reopen society, we will again put children and young people first. Next, we will prioritise jobs and the business sector. The reopening will happen step by step and in a controlled fashion. When one step has been completed, the general principle will be to wait three weeks before moving on to the next. Once we see that it is safe and that infection rates are not rising again, we will move on to the next step of the plan. The Government’s reopening plan consists of four steps with an overview of which restrictions may be eased at each step. The first and preparatory step is to return to the national restriction level we were at prior to 25 March when the Government implemented new national measures to curb the infection increase in the weeks before Easter. The measures seem to have had the desired effect. The rate of newly registered cases dropped in the course of Easter. The number of hospital admissions, however, is still at a level not seen since April of last year. Many people travelled during Easter, and fewer have gotten tested. We have seen the same pattern during other vacation and holiday periods. More ordinary weekdays must therefore pass before we learn more about the infection situation following Easter. Next week, the Government will consider whether it is prudent to reverse all or some of the national measures implemented 25 March. Madam President, I will now say more about how we are to assess when it is time to move on from one step of the reopening plan to the next. As already mentioned, to retain control, it will be necessary to first see the results of each completed step before moving on to the next. For the data to be sufficiently reliable, approximately three weeks need to pass between each step. We must be prepared to reverse the easing of restrictions if infection rates flare up again. The situation will be assessed according to these three aspects: These three aspects must be assessed together and must always be weighed against the measures’ consequences for people and the economy. The first aspect to consider is the infection rates and the disease burden. There is still a risk that the spread of infections will spiral out of control. As we have observed in recent weeks, the infection situation may change fast so long as significant parts of our population remain unvaccinated. We assume that this year, too, the spread of infections will decline in the summer season. However, the extent of the decline is uncertain, particularly since new and more infectious variants of the virus have appeared. Before we reopen society, infection rates must be low and stable, and the number of hospital admissions needs to decline from present day levels. At present, different mass testing pilots take place in Oslo, Bergen, Askøy and Molde. The pilot at Blindern is completed and showed that about 50 per cent of the students got tested. Of the total of approximately 2700 tests, 7 were positive. Now, after Easter, the goal is to get underway with systematic and regular testing in schools. Municipalities with the highest infection pressure in school-age children and teenagers will be prioritised. Rapid tests and self-tests are well suited for mass testing because such tests will not affect laboratory capacity, and because they are readily available to us. Mass testing may enable an increased number of pupils returning to school for in-person classes and for us to move more rapidly on to new steps of the reopening plan, provided that infection rates are suppressed. The capacity of the health care services is the next aspect in the assessment of what to reopen. This applies to the municipalities’ capacity for testing and infection tracing, as well as to the capacity of the hospitals. We must ensure that COVID-19 patients, as well as other people in need of treatment, will receive the best possible care. Experience indicates that capacity for infection tracing will be impacted before that of the hospitals, particularly during local outbreaks. The third aspect to be assessed is vaccination progress. As an increasing number of the population is vaccinated, the average age of infected people will drop. Young people who get infected are less likely to become severely ill and die, enabling us to handle a somewhat higher infection level. At present, 1 million vaccine doses have been administered in Norway. 725,000 people have received their first dose, and 290,000 have had their second dose. Our most elderly citizens have now received both vaccine doses, and many municipalities are underway in administering vaccines to people under the age of 75. Our best estimate, provided that vaccines are delivered as promised, is that everyone over the age of 18 shall have been offered their first vaccine dose in the course of July. However, this estimate is uncertain. As we approach summer, PfizerBioNTech and Moderna will deliver an increasing number of vaccine doses. We expect the Janssen vaccine to be delivered from April on, but we will have to wait until June for the lion’s share of vaccines from this supplier. The status of the AstraZeneca vaccine is still unclear. Madam President, The Government is now working on developing a corona certificate, allowing people to document that they have been vaccinated, have had a COVID-19 test or have natural immunity after having recovered from COVID-19. Norway participates in the European initiative on corona certificates, and the Norwegian solution will be in line with the EU Digital Green Certificate. The EU Commission and the WHO have a clear ambition for the European solution to be part of and adapted to an international solution. The Government is also exploring whether an additional, simplified corona certificate may be used domestically in order to expand and speed up the reopening process through digital documentation of individuals’ testing and vaccine status. The Government will also consider new guidelines for vaccinated people. Intense research focuses on whether the vaccines, in addition to protecting against infection, will have a transmission-blocking effect. Recent reports suggest that this is the case. Thus, the risk is reduced that vaccinated people transmit the infection to others. This is very good news. The National Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Directorate of Health are now assessing the bases of knowledge, and will update their recommendations when it is advisable to do so. For example, we may consider allowing exemptions from the duty to work from home, and also allowing a household to receive more visitors. We must also consider the rules for infection quarantine, entry quarantine and waiting quarantine for vaccinated people. We will come back to this at a later date. Madam President, With a few exceptions, Norwegian borders are to all intents and purposes closed for people not residing in Norway or who are not Norwegian citizens. People exempt from the restrictions are subject to a strict entry regime. Consequently, the number of people crossing the border is low. At Easter there was a 96 per cent reduction of international travellers departing from Norwegian airports, compared to 2019. Throughout the pandemic, Norwegian entry restrictions have been among Europe’s strictest. They will continue to be so. However, we must meet the needs for safe and predictable transport of medication to Norway, and for goods and critical staff which we cannot source In Norway. If we cannot do that, Norway will grind to a halt. At our borders, too, reopening will happen gradually and controlled. When considering the pace with which we may open the borders for new groups of travellers, we will, in addition to the three aspects, also take into account the infection situation in other countries and the experiences we continuously amass from the present entry regime. Therefore, we cannot be certain about just how much it will be possible to ease border restrictions at the various steps of the plan. The government has established an application-based entry scheme for people entering Norway to work here. The scheme, starting 20 February, permitted entry of foreign nationals having technical competence who carry out duties that are strictly necessary for ensuring that activities continue at Norwegian businesses. The scheme has now been extended to incorporate foreign employees with special skills crucial for building, operating or maintaining infrastructure. The Government considers further expanding this scheme next week. Initially, the overarching goal will to prioritise foreign employees who can contribute to curtailing the loss of value creation and jobs, infection control permitting. Madam President, I will now move on to say more about the national measures involved at each of the four steps of the reopening plan. I would like to emphasise, however, that the population must still be prepared for stricter local or regional measures to be implemented for shorter or longer periods. The risk of local outbreaks will remain as long as children and young people are not vaccinated. Significant regional outbreaks may also make it necessary to put the national reopening on hold. Step 1 As already mentioned, next week the Government will consider whether all or parts of the national restrictions implemented before Easter may be removed. This is step 1 of the reopening, and it may be regarded as a preparatory phase. At step 1 we will among other things consider allowing: As indicated by the Minister of Culture before Easter, next week the Government will also consider allowing outdoor training matches for elite teams. To begin with, this may be relevant to football teams on the two highest league levels. The first week of May, the Government plans to open up for league games for these leagues. Again, this will depend on the infection rates and sound compliance with infection control protocols. Schools and kindergartens will, at every step of the plan, follow the traffic light model. Any need for tightening of measures will be made by the individual municipality based upon the local situation. Step 2 At step 2, the Government will prioritise children, young people, and students. There will also be changes that will mean a lot to all of us. In general, the Government still recommends that events and activities take place outdoors when possible. The present-day outlook is that given the current development of the epidemic and the progress of the vaccination effort, it will not be possible to initiate the second step of the reopening plan until the last half of May. Step 2 will include allowing: The recommendation to avoid travelling abroad still applies, unless strictly necessary. For travellers entering Norway, strict requirements to undergo entry quarantine and mandatory testing will still apply. Restrictions will be eased on family visits from abroad, applying both to family members from within the EEA area and family members who are third-country nationals. We will, among other things, consider opening up for visits from romantic partners and grandparents living abroad. Restrictions will also be eased for prioritised groups of employees who need to travel to and from Norway. At this time, it is too early to decide which guidelines will apply to the celebration of 17 May – Constitution Day. Towards the end of April, the Government will present further information about advice and recommendations that will apply to the celebration. As regards guidelines for festivals, concerts and other events planned for the summer, the Government will come back with further information in early May. Step 3 At step 3 we may ease restrictions further, both in the private and the public sphere, for example may more people meet each other. Step 4 Much of everyday life will be almost back to normal. However, infection control measures will still apply, as will the requirement to keep a safe distance and to stay at home if you are ill or in quarantine. We may still need some of you to work from home. The permitted number of spectators/participants attending big public events and recreational sports and leisure activities will remain limited and continuously assessed. Restrictions on entry to Norway may still apply, particularly for third-country nationals. Travellers must expect requirements to quarantine upon arrival in Norway and to be tested when arriving from certain areas. The rules for travelling to Norway must also be assessed continuously. What each step will entail may change based on, for example, new knowledge about how infections spread and the experience we amass in the course of the reopening process. It may become necessary to slow down and move more cautiously ahead. The plan will become increasingly specific the closer we get to reopening. Madam President, I understand that many people would like us to present a plan with more specific dates. A reopening plan with fixed dates would create better predictability if it were possible to say with certainty how the pandemic will develop in the time to come. This is not the case. The uncertainty is too great. New mutations may appear, changing the rules of the game again. There is uncertainty about how quickly Norway will receive vaccines and how well vaccines will prevent the spread of infections. Therefore, I believe that it is not wise to fix the various steps of the plan to any specific dates, but rather to assess the steps continuously in accordance with established criteria. Even European countries which have plans with fixed dates are clear in their reservations, saying that what will decide the pace of the reopening is the infection situation. The UK motto is “data, not dates”. In Germany reopening is based upon an approach where threshold values for the infection situation determine the progress, as well as any reversal, of the plan. Despite the many uncertainties, the Government assumes that we will have completed the first three steps of the plan by the end of June unless we experience significant setbacks. The National Institute for Public Health has conducted various model simulations to demonstrate how the infection may develop under different scenarios. The simulations show that we must be prepared for a certain increase in infections in the course of the autumn. How significant the increase will be, depends on how many people are vaccinated and how well the vaccine works. The public support of the vaccination programme and the results so far on the effect of the vaccines, give cause for optimism. But new infections may still occur among children, young people, and people, who for various reasons, have declined to be vaccinated. If we need to implement new restrictions, we believe that they will be much less comprehensive than the restrictions we have at present. Out of the crisis together Madam President, Step by step, and little by little, this plan will allow our lives to return to normal. Everyday life will be much as we remember it from before 12 March of last year. It will be a time for joy, expression and freedom. But this is not necessarily the case for all of us. Some people will struggle longer than others with the consequences of the pandemic. Some of us may suffer health problems after having been ill. Some children have experienced violence at home. Some will have problems catching up at school. Some will suffer mental health issues. Others may have problems getting a job. The Government’s target is that no one shall have to stand alone in dealing with their challenges caused by the pandemic. We have faced this together. Our goal now must be to come out of this crisis together, too. Therefore, the Government will follow up the efforts on these areas in the time going forward. We will assess challenges and identify targeted measures. Much of this work is already underway. More initiatives will come. I will next say a bit more about each of these efforts. I take the opportunity to advise that the Government will come back to this also in the revised national budget. Long-term effects Madam President, Recently, the National Institute of Public Health wrote their first review about long-term effects following illness due to COVID-19. The possible effects may include shortness of breath, fatigue or a reduced sense of smell and taste. Last year the Norwegian Directorate of Health published national guidelines for rehabilitation following COVID-19. Many people will receive satisfactory treatment offered by municipal health care services. In contrast, other people must be seen to by institutions offering special competence and may need comprehensive multidisciplinary medical assessment by specialists. At present, the Norwegian Directorate of Health is about to launch a national plan to rehabilitate patients recovering from COVID-19. Many people have shared poignant stories. There are ongoing studies in Norway and abroad aiming to amass research-based knowledge about the long-term effects of COVID-19. We want to use this knowledge to establish robust rehabilitation services for people who have suffered from COVID-19, allowing as many people as possible to return to a normal everyday life. Mental health (including loneliness issues) Many people have struggled with an increased feeling of loneliness and sadness, and they miss having more contact with others. For the majority, anxious thoughts and feelings of loneliness may pass when life returns more or less to normal. However, we know that for some people, particularly those who are already vulnerable, loneliness may cause more mental problems. The situation we are in right now is particularly demanding for children, young people, and others who do not feel safe at home. Several initiatives have been taken to reduce the negative impact of the infection control measures: As of May 2020 and up until now, 2.8 billion NOK have been granted for measures aiming to help vulnerable groups. The funding has been used to boost resources at public health clinics, school health services and psychiatric services for children and young people. It has also gone towards maintaining low-threshold services and activity programmes, and for boosting telephone counselling services.  In the time to come, we must consider increasing our efforts. Therefore, the Government has established an expert group whose task is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on people’s mental health and on the issue of substance abuse. The expert group will submit their report by 30 April, suggesting specific actions to counter the challenges. The Government will use their report as a basis for our efforts to find out how to avoid a situation where mental health issues experienced during the pandemic become lasting problems. Keeping up at school This year, the quality of the education offered to many pupils has been somewhat lower than in a normal school year. Though homeschooling has worked well for many pupils, we know that this has not been the case for all. There are also geographical differences in terms of how much of the teaching sessions have been digital. The Government has granted 500 million NOK to support the municipalities in establishing new or expanding existing summer school programmes for summer 2021. Summer school is aimed at providing children at primary school level extra academic, social and cultural input. FAFO (the Norwegian Institute for Applied International Studies) has assessed the impact on upper secondary schools (high schools) and found that the dropout rate for the academic year 2019/2020 has not risen. However, we still do not know much about the dropout rate for the present academic year, and it is too early to say anything about any possible long-term consequences for the pupils. As we start the reopening process, we must implement measures to ensure that pupils who have fallen behind due to the pandemic will get the support and education that they need. We must also ensure that apprentices get a chance to earn their craft certificate. The Government will extend the grant that supports measures aimed at upper secondary pupils who have been unable to obtain all their grades on their upper secondary education certificate. The grant budget is 150 million NOK in 2021. The Government permits the county municipalities to use the grant for summer school programmes and other courses beyond the counties’ ordinary education programmes. The stimulus grant for apprentices is extended with 100 million NOK for 2021. Eligible for this grant are apprentices that have been or are at risk of being laid off. The grant shall also go towards establishing more apprenticeships. The grant is especially aimed at supporting trade studies that suffer harsh setbacks due to the pandemic. The Government has also granted 150 million NOK to support an extended programme for people who do not get an apprenticeship. This initiative is temporarily named “Pupils’ trade certificate” and will be a better programme than the present-day Vg3 programme taught at upper secondary school. Children and young people have made great sacrifices in the course of this pandemic. We must now extend a hand to those who have fallen behind academically as a consequence of this. Students at universities, university colleges and vocational schools For students at universities, university colleges and vocational schools, student life has turned out very different than planned. Some students struggle with maintaining study progression. Others experience financial hardships because they have lost their part-time job or have problems finding part-time jobs to support their income. The Government has focused on supporting the students, most recently through a package of measures presented in January. This package includes funding for educational institutions and student unions to employ students to support fellow students academically as well as socially. The Government wants to support the universities, university colleges and vocational schools in their efforts to give as many students as possible the chance to complete their spring term courses in accordance with standard study progression. Presently, the Ministry of Education and Research participates in a joint effort with representatives from the educational institutions and the students to identify compensatory measures that may be implemented quickly. We know that this period has been hard for the students, and we have focused on helping wherever possible. I am happy to see that the total dropout rate has not risen. Children and young people who have experienced abuse Violence and abuse against children and young people may be difficult to detect even when there is no pandemic. Children are often reluctant to talk about their experiences. In addition, many adults who suspect that things are not as they should be at a child’s home may find it difficult to ask the child about this. Some children and young people who are exposed to violence may need treatment for mental health issues. Treatment may be offered either by municipal services or specialist health care services. The Government has strengthened the competence and the capacity of these services, before and in the course of the pandemic. And, as already mentioned, we are considering further initiatives. The Government is putting a high priority on the effort to combat violence and abuse against children. 2021 is the final year of the Escalation plan against violence and abuse. This year we are boosting the effort with an additional 96 million NOK, leaving the total funding for the entire plan period at approx. 1.1 billion NOK. The work on this plan will continue, and the Government aims at presenting a new action plan to combat domestic violence (violence in close relationships) before summer. The Ministry of Children and Families and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security are now identifying the challenges related to violence and abuse during the pandemic, and are considering whether there will be a need for new targeted measures to be included in the revised national budget. Employment and job opportunities The Corona pandemic has caused the most serious setback to the Norwegian economy in the post-war period, and the impact on the labour market has been severe. Unemployment rates have dropped significantly since spring last year, but the rates are still markedly higher than before the pandemic. Presently, almost 212,000 persons are registered as job seekers with NAV (The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration). 115,000 of these are completely unemployed. Many of them are young people. These are people who wish to work. Further, we need for them to work. Many people who are laid off will probably be able to return to work quickly as soon as the infection situation improves. On the other hand, people who have been completely unemployed for a longer period of time may experience problems getting back to work. Consequently, there is a risk that the pandemic may impact the labour market also in the long-term perspective. A new salary support scheme will provide businesses with an incentive to allow furloughed employees to return to work more quickly. This will make it possible for employers to prepare for reopening their business despite even though revenues are still down. We may thus avoid that the unemployment rates freeze a high level. The scheme is the result of a joint effort with the employers’ and employees’ organisations. Employment schemes are pivotal measures to get unemployed citizens back to work. In order to counteract a situation where unemployment rates remain permanently high, the Government has greatly increased the capacity of the employment programmes this year, and NAV is granted extra funds so as to, among other things, be able to provide follow-up services to the long-term unemployed. People with little or no formal education are particularly vulnerable in the current situation. Consequently, in spring 2020 the Government launched the project “The Education Boost”, which is aimed at improving competence and capacity at all education levels. For 2021 “The Education Boost” initiative is granted a further 2.8 billion NOK. This means that “The Education Boost” for 2020 and 2021 will offer approximately 80,000 people the opportunity to get more education and enhance their competence. These areas, too, will be considered in connection with the revised national budget. Conclusion Madam President, Last year was a tough year. I think we can all agree with His Majesty the King when he addressed the nation before Easter, saying: “This is starting to take its toll”. Unfortunately, the pandemic is still not over, and we must be prepared for further setbacks. However, the present situation allows us to start planning for the time after the pandemic. Doing so, we must bear in mind the following: For some of us, the pandemic is not over when the restrictions are gone. For some, the pandemic is over only once they have returned to work, once their health is restored, or once they have caught up at school. We have been facing this crisis together. We will come out of this crisis together, too.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/the-prime-ministers-address-7-april-2021/id2842691/"
"24"," New Year Speech 2021 ",2021-01-01,"It marked an opportunity to open ourselves up to hope, and to dream in a bigger format. But the decade did not start the way we had hoped or dreamed about. 2020 has turned out to be a very difficult year. At the beginning of the year we were confronted by the outbreak of COVID-19. At the end of the year, we were witness to the destructive power of the forces of nature. The municipality of Gjerdrum in the district of Romerike has been struck by one of the worst quick-clay landslides in recent times. Many people have been affected. Many have lost their homes. Many have been evacuated. And many are apprehensive about what will happen next. Out thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this disaster. We would like to express our deepest appreciation to the rescue workers for their tireless efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on our society for most of this year. The disease has taken lives. Many have become ill. Many have lost their jobs. More and more people have found themselves feeling lonely and isolated. Our natural desire for closeness has been overridden by the need to keep a safe distance. The Government has been forced to take decisions very quickly. Often in situations fraught with uncertainty. We did not get everything right on our first try. But we have revised our decisions to incorporate what we are learning along the way. Two waves of infection have hit Europe since March. In both instances, Norway has coped better than many other countries. Fewer people here have needed to be admitted to hospital, and fewer have died. Our economy has fared better as well. There are many reasons why we have managed to cope so well so far. We introduced measures at an early stage. The countries that waited have been more severely affected. And Norwegians by and large have willingly taken part in the national effort. People have put their own interests and dreams aside in order to protect the elderly and other risk groups. This has helped to save lives. I am deeply grateful for, proud of and touched by the way the Norwegian people have handled the greatest challenge to our society since World War II. We were there for each other when it really counted. Even though 2020 has brought many hardships, we will always look back with admiration on the way the people have contributed.   Twenty years ago, Tore Gjelsvik, a Norwegian WWII resistance fighter, published his reminiscences from the war years. The title of that work expresses the same hope I have for 2021: Better days are coming soon. Soon the day will come when we can hug each other again. Sit close to one another at a concert and sing at the top of our voices. Gather family members together across the generations to celebrate birthdays and holidays. And the high-school graduating class get up to its traditional capers. Better days are coming soon.   I wish I could say that better days will come tomorrow. But unfortunately, I can’t. We will still have to live with restrictive measures for some time to come.   Most of us can cope with not being able to live our normal lives for a while. It is not much fun, and it is exhausting, but we can get through it. But for those who were already feeling isolated to start with, the pandemic has made the situation worse. So I have a request for everyone tonight: Take a look around you. If you think someone you know is sitting at home all alone, pick up your phone. Give them a call. Find out how they are doing. It costs so little, but can mean so much.   Better days are coming soon. To put it somewhat facetiously: they will be coming by lorry and air freight. Obviously, I am thinking of the COVID-19 vaccines. The successful production of new vaccines in such a short time is a triumph for science and for international cooperation. That is worth reflecting on at a time when conspiracy theories spread like wildfire. A time when more people appear to be questioning the value of science and knowledge. And when some assert that each nation should be an entity unto itself.   I beg to differ. The pandemic has made it very clear that no country will be able solve these challenges on its own. The EEA Agreement has been a vital tool for providing Norway with access to vaccines. Our good neighbour, Sweden, has provided special help as well. We are grateful for this. Norway has also taken responsibility. We played a key role in establishing the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) in 2016. CEPI’s mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines against rare and emerging infections diseases. We are proud of this.   The pandemic has truly taught us that the countries of the world can achieve much more working together than each on its own. If you become ill with COVID-19, a ventilator from Switzerland may help you to breathe. The medicines you need may have been manufactured in Italy or India. One of the vaccines we will be using was developed in the US and Germany. And has been tested on over 40 thousand volunteers across six countries on five different continents to ensure that it is safe for you. Norway has also contributed. Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology have developed a method that makes it possible to test thousands of people each day. This method has been exported to Denmark and India, among others. There is a lot that we in Norway can achieve. But there are only just over five million of us here. We will never be able to meet all of our needs all by ourselves. We will always have a better, safer country if we can take advantage of the advancements made by the nearly eight billion people outside Norway.   I first became involved in politics almost 45 years ago. Much has changed over these years. And mostly for the better. This has of course also led to changes in which issues should be given priority. But the need for everyone to have a secure job to go to has always been a priority for me. Which has made it all the more distressing to witness the negative impacts of COVID-19 on so many businesses. Particularly in the travel, food and beverage, culture and entertainment, and transport industries. I know that the situation is tough for many of you now. Better days are coming soon. For us, and for you. We will once again be able to go to concerts, cafés and restaurants together. Allow tourists to enjoy the best that Norway has to offer. I am looking forward to that. But until that day comes, we will work to support the businesses that are struggling. The state cannot assume all the risk. But we will provide good schemes that make it possible to save many of the viable companies. I would also like to encourage everyone who can to support their local businesses during this period.   Many are finding that their jobs have become more demanding now. But it is even more demanding to be one of those who no longer has a job to go to. Some people will be able to return to their former jobs. Others will have to look for new employment, and will receive help to do that. The situation for newly qualified graduates will be especially unpredictable. Our young people have sacrificed a lot to limit the spread of infection. We owe it to them to do everything we can to offer them a bright future. Secure jobs. An effective climate policy. And not least – targeted initiatives to increase skills and knowledge. In line with this, a greater number of teachers are receiving further education in the subjects they teach. Funding has been allocated for several thousand new student places. We will continue to expand our national knowledge society. This is our way of thanking our young people for everything they have done in these trying times. We need to create more jobs in Norway. Fortunately, there are many businesses that are thinking proactively. I recently visited Edgeir Vårdal Asknes, CEO and co-founder of the digital energy consumer service, Tibber, in Førde. In the middle of the pandemic, Tibber has hired 50 % more staff. And in Sunnmøre, they are producing furniture at an unprecedented rate. When I visited the Ekornes facility I learned the company had hired 100 new employees. And the ambition is to hire another two hundred or so over the next five years. These companies are leading the way. The labour market of the future must be smart and innovative. And it must also be green. Moving forward, we will highlight hydrogen as an energy carrier. Hydrogen has an important role to play in areas where electricity and batteries are less efficient. We will work to produce more hydrogen-powered ferries. Earlier this December, the industrial concern Yara announced plans to fully electrify its plant in Porsgrunn. Production of emission-free fuel will further promote the development of green shipping. This demonstrates how climate policy can lead to new jobs. We have set ambitious climate targets to prevent dangerous climate change. In the next few days, the Government will present the first climate policy plan showing how we intend to reach the targets for emissions reductions in non-ETS sectors by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Norway. A number of the major challenges that were facing us before the pandemic will still be there after the pandemic is over. The need to be more inclusive is one of these. Having a job means having a source of income that puts food on your table and a roof over your head. But a job is more than just a source of income. A job is also an arena for fellowship. That is something I think everyone who has been confined to working from home has come to appreciate. Having a job is also about mastering new skills and the feeling of being useful to others. There are many people in Norway who have much more to give. But they never get the chance. This may be because they have an unfamiliar name, gaps in their CV, or a disability of some kind. In the time ahead, we must do more to address this. It is my hope that, after the pandemic, Norwegian society will be more inclusive, and everyone’s value will be recognised.   At this time of year, our thoughts always turn to all those who are working in other countries. And who are unable to be with their families and friends. There are many who are working hard, on behalf of us all, to make the world a better place. This year COVID-19 has really turned things upside down. I would like to thank you all for your efforts. We are thinking of you, particularly now at Christmas and New Year. Many people in Norway have experienced being in quarantine this past year. Including our beloved King and Queen. I would like to refer back to what the King said in his speech to the Norwegian people on 15 March 2020. He reminded us that we all need a little extra kindness during these days. Those are wise words indeed. When we are under strain, it is easy to express ourselves more forcefully than we really need to when we disagree. I would like to thank the King and Queen for all their support and wisdom at a particularly challenging time. A little more kindness makes it easier for all of us to stay the course.   There are many who deserve to be thanked after a year like this one. I would like to mention a few in particular. The personnel working at hospitals and elder care facilities are in a class of their own. Their work has been critical for the patients they have treated and has made us all feel safe and proud. The many dedicated individuals in our country, like the people at the Halden volunteer centre, who are making a huge effort to provide information about infection protection measures for those who are not so well-versed in the Norwegian language. Everyone who reaches out to people who are isolated and lonely. Like Karl Laugsan and the members of the National Association for Public Health in Ytterøy, who phone up everyone in the community who is living alone and invite them to share a meal. The staff and teachers at schools and day-care institutions, who work to give children and young people the best possible start in life. Who quickly shifted to online teaching and who have kept on working hard through the various levels of closure. The individuals working in transport, cleaning and retail services. For helping to keep the wheels of society turning smoothly. The staffs at the ministries, directorates, public agencies, counties and municipalities. And especially the employees at the National Institute of Public Health and the Directorate of Health. Many of you are still working long days and weekends. To provide advice, define rules, design compensation schemes and much more. Without you, it would not have been possible for Norway to manage the virus as well as it has. I would also like to thank the other political parties in the Storting for their constructive cooperation when the pandemic broke out. And finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all of you who are following the advice and rules to prevent the infection from spreading. This is neither easy nor enjoyable. I know. But when we do it together, it works. And we have to hold out for a bit longer. That is how we have managed to make it through 2020. By working together. And that is how we will manage to get through the beginning of 2021 as well. Happy New Year. Better days are coming soon.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/new-year-speech-2021/id2826293/"
"25"," Key Learnings and Action Points from the Ocean Panel ",2021-03-02,"I am joining you as we look back at a year that was far from what we had hoped and planned for. 2020 was supposed to be the ‘super year’ for the ocean. Instead countries had to protect its people and deal with the imminent threat of a virus. International meetings were cancelled and postponed. It seemed that our opportunity to put the ocean at the top of the international policy agenda was fading. Despite the great challenges brought by the pandemic, 2020 saw significant and much needed action to restore ocean health, enhance human well-being and create a more sustainable ocean economy.  The ocean plays an essential—and often unrecognised—role in all our lives. It makes life possible by providing half the earth’s oxygen and stabilising the climate. It provides nutritious food, jobs and medicine. It drives the global economy. It also makes life more enjoyable, providing spiritual, cultural and recreational value to billions of people. Much of the world’s population have experienced lockdown over the past year. Many of us have come to appreciate more than ever the positive impact nature – including blue nature – has on our well-being. Resilience is a key concept. The ocean has contributed immensely to the planet's resilience by storing heat and reducing the effect of global heating – up until now. Now we need the knowledge, the insights and the wisdom to start helping the ocean. We need other measures, innovations, ways of mitigation – the list is long. Because the health of the ocean is under threat. The ocean is becoming warmer, more acidic, stormier, less predictable and less resilient. It is often the world’s most vulnerable people who suffer the worst of these impacts. A depleted ocean makes it more difficult to sustain life on earth, tackle climate change and meet the SDG’s. The science is clear – the ocean is not too big to fail, and the problems facing it are not too big to fix. The solutions to restore ocean health exist, and we urgently need to implement them. That is why three years ago, the Ocean Panel’s 14 heads of state and government came together to develop a transformative set of recommendations. These transformations and a visionary report were launched in December 2020, endorsed by the 14 heads of state and government.  The Ocean Panel countries have reached consensus on 74 priority actions, covering issues including plastic pollution, illegal fishing and ocean finance.  Together, they point to where the world should be in the next decade, when the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development conclude. If implemented these recommendations can deliver a sustainable ocean economy that benefit people everywhere and effectively protect the ocean. But how did the Ocean Panel get to the Transformations?  First we assembled an international, multidisciplinary team of more than 250 experts (nearly half of them women), representing 48 countries or regions. Over the past three years these ocean experts provided the latest thinking on the issues facing our ocean. The solid scientific platform combined with leaders' willingness to be guided by facts and research reinforced a creative and innovative diplomacy. I believe there may be lessons to be drawn here also for other processes of international cooperation. Coalitions of the willing taking the lead and showing a way forward. 20 scientific papers informed the Ocean Panel’s deliberations and provided a blueprint for how to achieve a sustainable ocean economy. Covering topics from food and energy to climate change and conservation. So what did we learn from this impressive volume of knowledge? We learned that the ocean is even more important than we thought: for human and planetary health, for climate and food security, for local jobs and the global economy. We learned that ocean health is more at risk than we thought, because different pressures add up and contribute to rapid and unpredictable changes in ocean ecosystems But importantly, we also learned that the ocean holds many of the urgent solutions humanity and the planet need: In fact, we can and we must produce more from the ocean. And we have to do it in ways that mitigate climate change, preserve biodiversity, regenerate ocean health and leave no one behind. If we create a healthy ocean and sustainable ocean economy, we will unlock the ocean’s potential to help solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges. In sustainable ocean economy, effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity must go hand in hand. As the world looks to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, it is crucial that we restore economic activity without restoring old patterns of environmental damage. Making the ocean a cornerstone of COVID-19 recovery can help create a more resilient and sustainable future. Investment in areas such as ecosystem restoration, mariculture and offshore renewable energy could create jobs, spur economic growth and help protect the ocean.  To help create sustainable ocean economy, Ocean Panel members have set an ambitious goal to achieve 100% sustainable ocean management of areas within national jurisdiction by 2025. We have also committed to supporting a global target of protecting 30% of the ocean. Ocean Panel members manage nearly 40% of the world’s coastlines and nearly 30% of its exclusive economic zones. This means that by 2025, an ocean area roughly the size of Africa will be sustainably managed. Ocean Panel members will achieve the 100% commitment by putting into place sustainable ocean plans. These plans represent a change from business as usual. Rather than managing the ocean sector by sector, these plans will seek to manage the ocean in an integrated way, and for the 100% target to be adapted to local conditions. These plans require that science and knowledge on all relevant aspects of sustainability need to be brought to the table when making political or management decisions on sustainable protection and use of the ocean environment. While the pandemic brought a significantly different backdrop to 2020 from that expected, the Transformations are a cause for celebration. The 14 countries, all at different stages of development and with different perspectives, came together amid a pandemic. They reached political consensus on an issue that is essential to the well-being of the economy and to humanity. Efforts are already underway to scale and finance this new ocean action agenda. Stakeholders from the private sector, research organisations and civil society are coming together to accelerate the work of the Ocean Panel by forming action coalitions. Coalitions focused on ocean renewable energy, tourism and shipping are already underway. For too long the ocean has been out of sight and out of mind, and largely absent from global policy conversations. But the tide is turning. We have the knowledge and policy, and now is the time to act together. At the World Ocean Summit, where the worlds of finance, policy and research meet, we have the people who can implement these solutions. Together we can - and we must - provide the finance, skills, and expertise we need to accelerate the transition to a sustainable ocean economy. We thought the ocean was too big to fail, then too big to solve. Now we know that the ocean is too big and too central to humanity’s future to ignore. To achieve a sustainable ocean economy it is critical that other world leaders, businesses, investors and civil society join the Ocean Panel in our efforts. By working together, the world can ensure that by 2030, all ocean areas under national jurisdiction are sustainably managed. The ocean gives us so much, we invite you to join the Ocean Panel members in giving the ocean 100%.  And we invite you to support and use the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Ocean science will not only be good at diagnosing problems of the ocean but will also deliver solutions - that benefit people, planet and the economy.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/key-learnings-and-action-points-from-the-ocean-panel/id2834648/"
"26"," Prime Minister’s introduction to coronavirus press conference ",2021-01-18,"In the statement, I was clear that the infection situation in Norway remains serious. This morning, I spoke with various heads of government. In many of the European countries, there are curfews, lockdowns, major concerns regarding the rapid spread of the British mutated virus, high numbers of fatalities and buckling healthcare services. Norway has one of the very strongest border controls in Europe, and a relatively moderate level of measures imposed on our residents and businesses. I believe this is an appropriate prioritisation. At home, the infection numbers have increased during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays and into the new year.The disease also spread into new areas.The new variant of the virus – which is far more contagious – concerns us. Throughout the crisis, we have attempted to strike a balance between what is proportional in light of the infection situation and taking a precautionary approach and acting quickly enough. At the start of this year, we feared that the pandemic could get out of control and that Norway could be entering a new wave of infections. On this basis, the Norwegian Government decided on 3 January to introduce strict measures, nationwide. It is too soon to fully assess the effects of these measures, but the infection numbers we are currently looking at indicate that they have been effective. I am pleased that people throughout the country have contributed to the effort of reducing the infection numbers. Thank you so much. However, infection in Norway remains at such a high level that it is necessary to continue the strict measures. Therefore, most of the prevailing national infection control measures and recommendations will remain in effect. At the same time, we are making some adjustments to the national recommendations, effective Wednesday 20 January. We are doing this, among other things, in order to make the everyday lives of children and young people a little more normal. These are changes: Even though we are now adjusting the national recommendations somewhat, the backdrop is serious – both in Norway and, not least, in several European countries, which are experiencing high fatality rates and overwhelmed hospital capacity. We cannot allow for this to occur here. Therefore, we must be prepared to live with measures that restrict our lives, even though immunisation is well underway. As Bent said in the Storting, more than 80 per cent of the Norwegian population now say they will very likely or likely accept the vaccine. This morning, 48,680 Covid-19 immunisations were registered in the national immunisation register, SYSVAK. Yesterday, the very first person to be vaccinated here in Norway received his second dose. We hope that a large share of the high-risk groups will be vaccinated by Easter. We now believe we will be able to offer the vaccine to all adults who wish to receive it this summer. There are still some uncertainties regarding deliveries and which vaccines will be approved. Therefore, we must make reservations in this regard.  There is light at the end of the tunnel. However, it is quite some time until we can relax. I have an important message for the Norwegian people today: We must continue to take responsibility together. We must take responsibility to avoid personally becoming infected, to avoid infecting others and we must limit physical social contact. But we must also take responsibility for one another. Many people are struggling at this time. Some have been struggling for a long time. There are many good help lines and professionals who can help those of you who are struggling. But it is also important that we take responsibility for one another. Make a phone call, go for a walk, ask others how they are doing. We need to care about one another.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/prime-ministers-introduction-to-coronavirus-press-conference/id2828835/"
"27"," The Prime Minister’s introductory remarks at a press conference on the coronavirus and entry into Norway ",2021-01-27,"On 21 December, we halted air traffic and introduced a testing requirement for everyone who had travelled from the UK in the last 14 days. Since that time, the Government – following expert advice – has been tightening and strengthening the rules that govern who is permitted to enter Norway. What we see is that the mutated virus has spread widely since then in many countries that do not monitor the extent of mutations in the same way that Norway, Denmark and the UK do. That is why the Government today has decided – on the recommendation of the health authorities – to introduce very strict rules on who may enter the country. Starting at midnight, in the earliest hours of Friday morning, we will introduce the strictest rules on entering Norway since 12 March of last year. In practice, the border will be closed to everyone who does not live in Norway. Exemptions are provided for: This will ensure that critical goods and services can enter Norway. But it means many immigrant workers will not be able to come in the weeks ahead. On 3 January, the Government introduced strict national measures to counter the spread of infection. This was not only because of our deep concern about the contagion in Norway. It was also because we were unsure whether the mutated variant from the UK – and other infectious variants of the virus – had come to this country and could spread. The same considerations were on the table on 18 January when, for the most part, we extended these national measures until further notice. We can see that the measures have worked. The entry restrictions will now entail stricter testing and quarantine controls. We are discovering more people who are infected, and they are being placed in quarantine. The domestic measures have also worked. The weekly report by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health for the third week of January shows a 53-per-cent decrease in the number of infection cases since the first week of the month, which was the worst for infections since the pandemic began. The R number is now estimated to be 0.6. I asked everyone in Norway to join a forceful collective effort on 3 January. The apparent result of this effort is that the mutated virus has not spread as much as it could have otherwise. You stepped up to the challenge – as you have again and again throughout the pandemic. To all who took part, thank you! Last weekend, the Government introduced strict measures in Nordre Follo and 24 other municipalities in eastern Norway. The aim was to block the spread of the more contagious variant of the virus and to gain an overview of the situation. These strict measures are intended to be short term. We may also introduce similar measures elsewhere in the country if this variant of the virus is found to be spreading. The spread we are witnessing in the rest of the world is serious. In our current circumstances, the Government believes strong restrictions are absolutely necessary to reduce the risk of importing more infectious variants of the coronavirus. These are intrusive measures, and the Government will reassess the situation in two weeks. We seek close cooperation with employer and employee organisations to identify good solutions within a strict regime. And to be able adjust measures if that becomes necessary. In any case, we must be prepared to live with stricter entry restrictions for a while longer than the 14 days. We are aware that this tightening of entry rules will affect a great many people. Important work may come to a stop, companies may find it hard to fulfil contracts, and friends and families will be unable to meet and visit. Many will ask if these actions are proportional to the situation we face, at a time of declining contagion in Norway. The answer is yes. The Government shares the assessment of the Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health that this is the right thing to do, precisely because the infection situation in Norway differs significantly from that of most other countries. The share of Norway’s population that is infected is lower, and we are able monitor the more contagious variant better than most other countries. That is why it is right for us to continue having entry rules that are among the strictest in Europe. At the same time, we must learn from what has happened elsewhere. The experience of other countries indicates that the new variant of the virus has the potential to be highly transmissible. We have watched as other countries, such as Ireland, have gone in a matter of weeks from low rates of infection to national transmission rates that are out of control. The consequences for children and young people, places of work and society as a whole are significant when it becomes necessary once again to shut down for a long period of time. Our joint efforts after Christmas have given us an advantage in tackling the new coronavirus variant. The fact that our borders in practice are closed will help us to keep that advantage. Fortunately, we have reached the point where more and more people are getting vaccinated, so that the most vulnerable in society are protected against infection. This work is well underway. Successfully cracking down on this more contagious variant of the virus, and delaying its ability to spread in Norway, will therefore be of tremendous value. So that fewer people become seriously ill and die of COVID-19 in our country. When we announced our measures in early January, I said … That we were well into a marathon. That we could see the end of it. But it turns out that the final stretch of this marathon may include some very steep hills, which all of us must climb to ensure a result where everyone – as many Norwegians as possible – crosses the finish line.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/the-prime-ministers-introductory-remarks-at-a-press-conference-on-the-coronavirus-and-entry-into-norway/id2830391/"
"28"," Report of the Coronavirus Commission ",2021-04-26,"Thank you for this opportunity to brief the Storting on the way the Government intends to follow up the Coronavirus Commission’s report. The Coronavirus Commission’s overall assessment is that the authorities have managed the pandemic in a sound manner.  The Commission points out that in a demanding situation for the country, the authorities adapted quickly and took decisions of crucial importance to the evolution of the crisis. After over a year of pandemic, Norway has one of Europe’s lowest mortality rates and its economy is among the least affected. I would also like to add that we have had less stringent domestic measures than many other countries. And we have a health service that has managed to maintain most of its normal activities.  The coronavirus pandemic has been the most difficult challenge that Norwegian society and the authorities have faced since the Second World War.  Particularly at the beginning, we were forced to take decisions in a situation fraught with uncertainty and without reliable information about the effects of the infection control measures. That is also why we made it clear that we would make some mistakes. It has been important to act decisively and then adjust our approach as needed, rather than to wait until it was too late to take decisions.  We have learned along the way, and we have corrected our course when this has been necessary. The Commission points out that we were not adequately prepared to deal with a crisis of this kind. We will consult the report closely and learn from it. That is why the Government took the initiative to appoint the Coronavirus Commission. The Commission’s report contains 17 central conclusions and 63 lessons and recommendations. Today, I will focus on the most important of these. We have asked the Coronavirus Commission to continue its work. So far, the Commission has evaluated Norway’s preparedness prior to the crisis and the response in the first phase of the pandemic. When the pandemic is over, we will conduct a thorough review of the organisation of the response, our emergency preparedness plans and relevant legislation. The Government will then present a white paper based on this and the Commission’s final report. We are still in a pandemic, and we do not intend to change the crisis management framework in the midst of a crisis. Nevertheless, we see that some of the points raised by the Commission have already been addressed, or can be addressed quickly. I will come back to this. Emergency preparedness Madam President,  As I have already mentioned, the Commission’s overall assessment is that the authorities have managed the pandemic in a sound manner. At the same time, the Commission has concluded that there is room for improvement in a range of areas. I will now go through some of the issues that have been highlighted. The Commission points out that Norway was not adequately prepared when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. The authorities had not designed scenarios or carried out exercises to prepare for a situation where large parts of society would have to be shut down. I agree that we have not adequately challenged assumptions about how pandemics should be dealt with in Norway in our emergency preparedness efforts.  The responsibilities of the various health sector entities and coordination during crises generally is described in Norway’s national health preparedness plan. This was last updated by the Ministry of Health and Care Services in 2018. The national emergency preparedness plan for outbreaks of severe infectious diseases was adopted in 2019. This is a general plan that covers various types of infection, not just one type of virus. The decision to draw up the plan was taken on the basis of experience gained from the handling of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 and the work on the national strategy for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) threat preparedness and response. The biological events preparedness committee was also established in 2019. Its purpose is to bring together decision-makers at agency level and from various sectors and to strengthen coordination of preparedness efforts and response to biological events. An influenza pandemic was considered to be the most likely crisis scenario. Norway was therefore prepared for a potential influenza pandemic, and the authorities had drawn up a national influenza pandemic preparedness plan putting in place systems and procedures for national action to deal with this.  This preparedness plan addresses a situation in which a large proportion of the population could fall ill, which in turn could lead to a high rate of sickness absence and many hospital admissions. The plan encompasses all sectors, but does not provide adequate analyses of the ramifications of high sickness absence and a high illness rate for society as a whole. Nor does the plan cover viruses that have other characteristics than the influenza virus.  In principle, the plan does not recommend introducing measures to restrict the activities of the population or parts of the population, as the costs could be huge and the benefits limited. It also advises against closing borders and introducing quarantine for suspected cases or mass testing of people arriving in the country.  Instead, infection control measures were to be used to slow down transmission and ‘flatten the curve’ to keep too many people from falling ill simultaneously. The Government realised early on that a deceleration strategy would be very difficult to implement. The spread of infection could get out of control too easily, and the pressure on the health and care services would be too great.  Madam President, Norway thus had plans in place and was prepared for an influenza pandemic, but we were not prepared for a pandemic that would require the widespread shutdown of activities. A similar weakness in preparedness plans and crisis scenarios can also be found in other Western countries. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) plans, for example, have focused exclusively on the influenza virus because an influenza pandemic was considered to be the most likely scenario. Under WHO’s leadership, the international community has long worked to create a framework that would make it possible to avoid closing borders and to maintain economic activity, trade and cross-border mobility in the event of outbreaks of infectious diseases. The adoption of the International Health Regulations is an example of this. The way we have been tackling the pandemic for over a year now represents a paradigm shift. We have employed infection control measures to an extent and for a length of time few had imagined possible or had planned for. Our response has challenged assumptions about the tools that can be used to combat a pandemic. The Commission has also been clear on this point. It has stated that no Western country had foreseen tackling a pandemic in this way.  Madam President, One of the Commission’s conclusions is that the Government has paid little attention in its emergency preparedness efforts to how risk in one sector is affected by risks in other sectors. The Commission’s criticism is partly based on the fact that the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB) had determined that, of the various crisis scenarios it had developed, a pandemic was the most likely. DSB’s scenario describes a pandemic that the authorities were better prepared for, an influenza pandemic.  In DSB’s scenario, an influenza virus spreads quickly, the pandemic peaks after six weeks and lasts for four months. In the Commission’s view, there were shortcomings in DSB’s crisis scenarios, because they did not include a sufficiently broad assessment of the impacts on society. The Commission believes that a more in-depth analysis should have been carried out of the interaction between impacts in various sectors and the effects on society as a whole.  A pandemic exercise could have uncovered some of the weaknesses in the plans that the Commission has pointed out. At the same time, there is reason to question whether our training exercise would have focused on a pandemic that required a lengthy shutdown of society, given that over the past year there has been a paradigm shift, as the Commission describes it.  Crisis scenarios can be developed in several ways, and it is important to identify a reasonable level of detail. If scenarios are too detailed, there is a risk of using a great deal of resources to develop very elaborate plans for a crisis that will often differ widely from the crisis that actually strikes.  Just how detailed crisis scenarios should be, and the role they can and should play in preparedness efforts, is an important discussion. The Ministry of Justice and Public Security is now considering whether there is a need to further develop DSB’s crisis scenarios. The Coronavirus Commission’s assessment will provide important input to this work.  One key lesson is that we cannot just develop scenarios for what we consider to be the most likely crisis situations. We must also plan for less likely developments.  That said, I would like to emphasise that it will never be possible to plan for all crisis situations in advance. It is telling that the most important decisions taken by the Government, and those that have been most instrumental in ensuring that Norway has fared better than the majority of countries, were not in line with or based on existing plans.  Good crisis management entails tackling the unknown, taking decisive action and daring to make mistakes. At the same time, it is about having a fundamental framework for preparedness in place.  Preparedness is built up through systematic learning from exercises and events, the establishment of a system for crisis management and the development of concrete tools to be used in crisis management. The fact that we had previously identified the public functions that are critical to safeguard public security in Norway is one example.  We are prepared for the fact that major events can strike at any time, and we have a well-developed crisis management system that the public administration is familiar with, in part through participation in crisis management exercises. This has been vital to the Government’s pandemic response. Madam President, The pandemic has highlighted the degree to which a crisis can extend across sectors, and how impacts in one sector can have ramifications in another. It is important to assess potential cross-sectoral impacts both in preparedness efforts and during the response. All the ministries are required to coordinate their prevention, preparedness and crisis management efforts with other relevant ministries. In addition, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security has a coordinating role and is responsible for ensuring that cross-sectoral issues are addressed. The ministries are therefore familiar with a cross-sectoral approach. For example, since the new Security Act entered into force, identifying cross-sectoral interdependencies has been an important element of the ongoing security work. During the pandemic, the Government has worked to maintain an overview of the overall impacts of the response. All the ministries have reported on the effects of implemented and potential measures. Assessing the cross-sectoral impacts has been a key element of this work, for example considering how closing schools and child day-care centres could affect access to qualified personnel and the economy, how the quarantine rules would affect capacity in the health and care services and how infection control rules affect vulnerable children and young people. In addition, we have had a good overview of our ability to maintain continuity in critical public functions, as previously defined.  My assessment is that when the crisis struck, the coordination of the response was effective. Decisions were taken at government level. An effort was made to ensure an integrated approach.  The Government will use the experience it has gained from the pandemic and the Commission’s conclusions to determine whether the need for and responsibility for cross-sectoral impact assessments should be clarified in Norway’s preparedness plans. The Government will also assess whether there is a need to establish a cross-sectoral cooperation mechanism at agency level to strengthen the coordination of prevention, preparedness and response to all types of events and crises. As already mentioned, a mechanism of this kind was established for the health sector in 2019. Personal protective equipment, medicines and activity in the health authorities Madam President, The Commission points out that the risk of shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) was made clear in connection with evaluations of the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Norway could have had and should have had larger stockpiles of PPE than we had at the start of the pandemic. I agree with this. This is a weakness in our preparedness that the Government has learned from.  At the same time, I am pleased that the Commission recognises the job that was done to ensure that Norway received sufficient supplies of PPE. In March 2020, a national procurement scheme was established to ensure the rapid delivery of PPE to municipalities and hospitals. Those who were involved worked 24 hours a day to acquire enough equipment, in what was a highly effective and creative effort.  The scheme that was put in place by the Directorate of Health, South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and the hospital purchasing authority, Sykehusinnkjøp HF, functioned well and the costs of the procurements were covered by the state. Later on in 2020, the situation concerning PPE delivery was normalised.  In the view of the Commission, too much priority was given to the specialist health services and too little to the municipalities when it was decided how the equipment should be distributed. We have noted this. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that systems were established for identifying needs in the municipalities. Municipalities that experienced shortages of equipment were encouraged to report their needs under the national scheme.  The county governors coordinated their efforts and distributed equipment between the municipalities based on the availability of equipment and infection situation in the individual municipalities. The various types of PPE were also unevenly distributed, reflecting the different ways the equipment was used in the municipalities and in the specialist health services. The distribution of the equipment was therefore not always in line with the overall distribution formula.  During the pandemic, we have accumulated a substantial national contingency stockpile, which is in addition to the local stockpiles held by the municipalities and the health authorities. For example, we now have a stockpile of respiratory protective equipment that is sufficient to cover what the Directorate of Health has estimated as 400 years of normal use. And we have enough eye protective equipment for more than 2000 years of normal use. The Directorate of Health is now preparing a report on how this national stockpile should be permanently organised, together with other measures to improve security of supply of PPE. One of the key issues in this work will be to clarify how to coordinate this national stockpile with the stockpiles held by the municipalities and hospitals.  Cooperation with other sectors, for example on procurement, national production and production agreements, will also be covered in the report. The Government aims to put forward a proposal for a permanent scheme for PPE stockpiling and preparedness in connection with the budget for 2022.  Throughout the crisis, we have managed to secure access to the medicines we need. The Commission believes that the review of Norway’s pharmaceutical preparedness carried out in 2019 has played a role in enabling us to rapidly implement the measures needed to secure supplies. As a result of our preparedness in this area and the fact that we have managed to keep the pandemic under control in Norway, we have also been able to assist Sweden by providing critical medicines for intensive care treatment.  Since May 2020, the Government has also developed substantial contingency stockpiles of other critical pharmaceutical products. The Government will present a proposal for a permanent solution in this area at a later stage.  Norway will never be self-sufficient in pharmaceuticals or medical technical equipment. The preparedness of Europe as a whole is therefore an important element in the discussion about Norway’s future preparedness. The Commission highlights the importance of strengthening cooperation within Europe and the Nordic region. This is in line with the Government’s ambitions. Throughout the crisis, Norway has actively promoted Nordic and European cooperation on access to pharmaceutical products.  The European Commission has proposed establishing a new European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), which to a large extent will address issues relating to the development and production of pharmaceuticals in emergencies, and in situations where availability is limited. It will be vital in terms of our national preparedness for Norway to participate in this work.  Madam President, The Commission points out that there was a significant reduction in hospital activity at the start of lockdown in March last year. In a situation of great uncertainty and with numbers of COVID-19 cases rising, it was necessary to reduce planned activities so that the hospitals could put in place new infection control routines and prepare to deal with a larger number of patients. This required more far-reaching adjustments for some hospitals than for others. We have noted that the Commission points out that the reduction in planned activities and the resumption of a more normal level of activity were not coordinated well enough, and that it could be beneficial to develop national plans to avoid an unnecessary reduction in treatment capacity. We will bear this in mind as we move forward. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that the Government attached great importance to maintaining emergency care services, and healthcare services for cancer patients, children and people with substance abuse or mental health problems. The specialist health services have been successful in this regard. In the areas of mental health care for children and young people and substance abuse treatment, waiting times were slightly shorter in 2020 than in 2019.  The Commission has received feedback from the hospitals that a shortage of personnel with the right knowledge and skills is the most significant obstacle to increasing intensive care capacity. I agree with that. In order to meet the needs in this area in the short term, a national training programme for nurses has been established on intensive care treatment for COVID-19 patients. In order to meet longer-term needs, we will carry out an assessment of the future, overall intensive care capacity required in our hospitals. But there is no doubt that capacity in this area must be increased. We have already asked the regional health authorities to train more intensive care nurses. At least 100 new trainee intensive care nursing positions will be established, and efforts to recruit, train and retain intensive care nurses in hospitals will be intensified. I was pleased to note the Commission’s view that cooperation between the specialist health services and the municipalities has been effective. Cooperation within the recently established healthcare communities has been significantly strengthened.  There has also been a considerable increase in the use of video and telephone consultations. This is a positive trend that we have encouraged. To ensure that this trend continues, the Government has set a target of 15 % per year for the proportion of outpatient consultations that are to be carried out by video or telephone. Measures introduced on 12 March Madam President, The Commission has carried out a very thorough review of the process leading up to the introduction of comprehensive infection control measures on 12 March. In the view of the Commission, the decision to impose the measures was right, and the Commission agrees with the Government’s analysis that the negative economic impacts would have been greater if the restrictions had been imposed later. I am pleased about that.  At the same time, the Commission points out that the package of measures should have been better evaluated and documented, and that the time pressure built up more than was necessary.  It is true that the time pressure was great. In the days leading up to 12 March, the infection was spreading far more quickly than anticipated. It is important to make clear that the measures that it was necessary to introduce represented a paradigm shift in public health preparedness and response. We have been used to countries in Asia dealing with outbreaks of infectious diseases differently from Western countries. This time, we had to recognise that our Western approach was not adequate, but the countries that had implemented measures before us were not many days ahead. Time was of the essence.  The Commission also points out that the decision to impose the measures should have been taken by the Government, referring to Article 28 of the Norwegian Constitution, which states that matters of importance are to be taken up in the Council of State.  Our priority on 12 March was to take decisions quickly, gain control of the situation and prevent the further spread of the virus.  It was the Directorate of Health that took the decision to implement the package of measures. Under Norway’s Act relating to control of communicable diseases, the Directorate of Health has been granted broad powers by the Storting to take decisions to protect the population in the event of outbreaks of communicable diseases. The emergency powers under the Act were activated as far back as January 2020 when the coronavirus was defined as a communicable disease that is hazardous to public health. Until 12 March, the pandemic was primarily dealt with as a health crisis, and in accordance with the distribution of roles set out in the plans. In light of the situation in the period leading up to 12 March, it was natural for the Directorate of Health to take the decision. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasise that although the formal decision to introduce the comprehensive set of measures was taken by the Directorate of Health, the decision was taken in consultation with the Government. However, I agree that the decision should have been adopted by the Government in the Council of State, as the Commission points out.  As a result of the measures that were imposed, the crisis went from being a health crisis to a crisis with ramifications for all sectors of society. After 12 March, the Government assumed both formal and practical responsibility for managing the crisis. As early as 13 March, the Regulations relating to quarantine etc. upon arrival in Norway were adopted in the Council of State. On 13 March, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security took over as lead ministry for the response. In an extraordinary meeting of the Council of State on 15 March 2020, the Government adopted new regulations on quarantine, isolation and a legal basis to prohibit stays at holiday properties. Madam President, The Commission points out that at the beginning of the pandemic, the authorities did not ensure that their infection control measures were in line with human rights and the Constitution.  This is a problem that the Government recognised early on and took steps to address. Measures are now assessed against the Constitution, Norway’s human rights obligations and the European Convention on Human Rights. These assessments are documented and made public, together with the basis for decisions regarding infection control measures.  As already mentioned, under the Act relating to control of communicable diseases, the municipal authorities and the Directorate of Health have been granted broad powers to implement necessary infection control measures in the event of a serious outbreak of a communicable disease that is hazardous to public health. The Act stipulates that the measures must be proportionate, i.e. reasonable, given the situation. I agree with the Commission that these powers are critical to ensuring a rapid response to outbreaks of communicable diseases. The purpose of the Act is to protect the population and prevent the spread of infection. The Act does not contain explicit provisions on democratic control of decisions, and I agree that this needs to be assessed more thoroughly. All the powers under the Act have been activated in connection with the pandemic, and we have gained completely new experience of how the Act works in practice. I agree that the Act should undergo a comprehensive revision, and that the Storting should be invited to consider the issue of democratic control, the processes and the division of roles again. The Government will initiate a review of this kind and will present more details to the Storting in due course.  Madam President, The Commission believes that too few consultative reviews have been held prior to decisions to implement infection control measures. I agree with the Commission that consultations on new legislation are an important democratic instrument, including during crises. Many important proposals have been circulated for review, but often with a short deadline for responding due to the need to get the legislation in place quickly. In many cases, consultations have not been held because of the immediate need to introduce rules to prevent the spread of infection.  Regulations relating to the introduction or amendment of infection control measures have generally not been circulated for review, whereas regulations under the Corona Act have by and large been subject to a short consultative review.  Most proposals for amendments to legislation have been circulated for review. However, this was not possible in the case of the Corona Act, given our assessment of the situation in mid-March 2020, but there was instead direct dialogue with the Storting and other affected stakeholders before the Government’s proposal was presented. The Official Norwegian Report that the Corona Act is based on was, however, circulated for consultation. Despite the fact that consultations have not been held consistently and the deadlines for responding have been short, it has been possible to provide input to the Government’s work. The recommendations of the various sectoral authorities have been published. Enquiries from private individuals, business and organisations about how the rules work and should work are taken into consideration when assessing the need for amendments. This public debate has helped to ensure that we have had the best possible rules for managing the spread of infection. As I see it, there is a need to think along new lines about how to develop and document measures and rules in protracted crises. This could include holding subsequent consultations on selected issues, commissioning committee reports or formalising the process for providing input to the development of legislation.  The Government shares the Commission’s view that a clear framework should be established for accelerating legislative processes during a crisis, without undermining fundamental democratic principles and the rule of law.  Throughout the pandemic, the Government has attached importance to ensuring that the Storting has been fully informed of the Government’s crisis management efforts. Initially, there were frequent meetings between the Government and the Storting’s special committee on the coronavirus.  And this is the ninth address to the Storting on the Government’s response to the pandemic, given by either myself or the Minister of Health and Care Services.  Choice of strategy and reopening of society in spring 2020 Madam President, In its report, the Commission gives its support to the Government’s choice of strategy. In March last year, we chose to take action to stop the spread of infection. This meant that we were able to gain control of the situation.  But there are limits to how long such a strategy can be maintained. As the Commission points out, the strategy must be assessed on the basis of the prospects for vaccines and immunity, the development of the virus, available treatments and the impacts on society.  The reason we were able to stick to our strategy is that it became clear early on that a vaccine would be developed fairly rapidly. Madam President, The Commission’s assessment is that we were right to open up society gradually during the course of the spring last year. This step-by-step approach enabled us to keep the situation under control. In line with our strategy, one of the first priorities was to ease restrictions for child day-care centres, schools and universities. I note that the Commission agrees with this order of priorities.  The Commission points out that in the process of reopening, the Government to some degree gave into pressure from certain interest organisations such as the Federation of Norwegian Industries and the Football Association of Norway. Throughout the crisis, the Government has maintained close contact with a wide range of stakeholders, such as industry organisations, employee and employer organisations and companies.  This contact has been vital for ensuring an effective response and for enabling us to gain an overall picture, adjust our course as necessary and introduce exemption schemes to avoid excessive impacts of the infection control measures. In some cases, we have agreed with the input we have received, and have made changes. In most cases, however, we have not complied with requests for exemptions or relaxation of restrictions.  During the pandemic, the level of measures has gone up and down, both at the local and the national level. But by managing to keep the spread of infection under control, Norway has overall had less stringent measures than many other countries. At the same time, our rules for entry into the country have been among the most restrictive in Europe. As early as 15 March last year, we introduced strict restrictions on the right of foreign nationals to enter Norway. In early summer we gradually eased the entry rules. At the time, we were one of the last countries in Europe to open up its borders.  Starting on 15 June, an exemption to the quarantine rules was introduced for people travelling to Norway from regions in other Nordic countries where the rate of transmission was low. From 15 July, this was extended to include people arriving in Norway from other EEA countries with a low rate of transmission. The infection situation was assessed on a weekly basis. The criteria for assessing the infection situation were determined on the basis of recommendations from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Directorate of Health. Madam President, In the Commission’s view, the Government lacked a plan for handling imported infections when a new wave of the transmission emerged in Europe in autumn 2020. The infection situation was moving in a favourable direction both in Norway and in most countries in Europe when we eased restrictions at our borders. The situation gradually deteriorated from late summer onwards. The requirement to undergo quarantine applied to people travelling from regions in the Nordic countries and countries in Europe where the rate of transmission was not low the whole time.  By this stage, we had a system in place whereby the rules on quarantine applied to people arriving in Norway from countries where the level of infection had exceeded specified thresholds.  In hindsight, we must acknowledge that the quarantine system was based on trust for too long. The Commission points in particular to the scheme allowing foreign workers to start working once they had received a negative test result. My assessment is that the entry system was based too much on trust, given the rising levels of infection in Europe in the autumn. At the same time, I would like to point out that the Act relating to control of communicable diseases stipulates that when implementing infection control measures, importance is to be attached to voluntary compliance by those affected. It was therefore natural to try out trust-based measures before tightening the rules.  Around the turn of the year, there was a need to increase restrictions at the borders due to the emergence of new variants of the virus that spread more easily and caused more serious illness. Foreign workers travelling to Norway are now required to provide documentation of a negative test, to take a test at the border, and to undergo quarantine at a designated hotel, and strict rules regarding which types of foreign workers are permitted to enter Norway have been introduced.  As a result of the decisive action we have taken, the proportion of confirmed cases originating from infections abroad has fallen dramatically and is currently very low.  Role of the municipalities Madam President, The Commission points out that substantial municipal-level responsibility for infection control in Norway is a strength. Norway’s municipalities have been responsible for implementing the testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine strategy and have thus played a key role in keeping the pandemic under control. Many municipalities think that information about amendments to the infection control measures and new expectations of the municipalities should have reached them at an earlier stage, before this information was made public. I can understand that. Dealing with a pandemic is no easy task. Decisions have to be taken quickly in many contexts. As a result, changes are often abrupt. If we had informed the municipalities of our decisions first, it would have taken longer for us to inform the rest of the population and other stakeholders. In balancing the various considerations involved, we decided to inform everyone of our decisions at the same time, and as quickly as possible. But we are constantly striving to improve information and the flow of information to the municipalities. Recently, for example, we have chosen to allow for a somewhat longer period between communicating amendments to the measures and their entry into force. Our aim is to give the municipalities more time to adapt. In the first phase of the pandemic, less attention was directed to municipal measures because, on the whole, the measures we implemented were national measures. Once we succeeded in suppressing the virus, we were able to take a more differentiated approach and suppress local outbreaks at the local level. In this phase, the municipalities have been followed up closely for example by the Institute of Public Health and the Directorate of Health. My assessment is that coordination has gradually improved. The framework has also become clearer. Early last autumn, a circular was sent out providing guidance to the municipalities on local measures that could be appropriate, the potential design of the measures and the legal considerations required.  We have also put in place a scheme that ensures that municipalities and other relevant stakeholders are informed of amendments to the regulations when these are sent for publication on the Lovdata website. The county governors also play a vital role in providing information and advice to the municipalities. In addition, they convey important information about the situation in the municipalities to the central authorities. The county governors are now required to review risk assessments from the Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health with the municipalities on a weekly basis.  Authorities’ management and coordination Madam President, The Commission gives a favourable account of the Government’s ability to deal with matters quickly and effectively. At the same time, it questions whether too many issues have been dealt with at too high a level.  In principle, I agree that matters should be dealt with at the lowest possible level. But during the pandemic it has been necessary to address a great many issues at government level. There is a need to see the overall picture, and to balance different considerations. This is a political responsibility. During the pandemic, there has also often been a need to cut through the various arguments and take decisions. As a result of this need to address so much at the political level, the division of tasks between the Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Directorate of Health has deviated from the procedures normally followed in crisis situations managed by the health and care services.  The Directorate of Health has had responsibility for providing the Government with information on which to base decisions and proposals for measures based on input, primarily from the Institute of Public Health, but also from the health authorities, the municipalities and the county governors.  The Ministry has then carried out an overall assessment, which in turn has provided the basis for the Government’s decisions. The Commission’s general impression is that cooperation between the various governmental actors in the health and care sector has largely been constructive and flexible.  But I have noted the Commission’s point that too much micromanagement can undermine the scope for comprehensive, strategic assessments. In my view, we have managed to balance these considerations by establishing a clear strategy early on in the crisis, which we have stuck to but have reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The Commission also points out that there has been extensive and close collaboration between the Directorate of Health and the Institute of Public Health. Both these organisations have been working under enormous pressure since the outbreak of the pandemic. This is the first time they have been able to test their cooperation and division of roles so extensively and over such a long period of time. It is only natural that it took a while to determine the optimum interface between them. When the pandemic is over, the Ministry of Health and Care Services will review and evaluate how the various actors in the health sector have cooperated and whether there is a need to make revisions to legislation, emergency preparedness plans and the organisation of crisis response.  The pandemic has affected everyone, but the effects have varied Madam President, The Commission has concluded that overall, the pandemic has been managed in a sound manner. I am pleased about that. The Commission points out that we adapted quickly and took decisions of crucial importance to the evolution of the crisis. After a year of pandemic, Norway has one of Europe’s lowest mortality rates and its economy is among the least affected.  We have many people to thank for this. We would have not been able to succeed without the population’s support of the infection control measures. In Norway, we have a high level of trust in each other. This puts us in a strong position to tackle crises.  We have sought to communicate openly about the assessments we have made, and have made public the expert recommendations we have received. I am pleased that in the view of the Commission, this openness has helped to promote trust.  We have not succeeded in reaching all segments of society equally. The Commission points out that we have had less success reaching the immigrant population than the rest of the population. We had measures targeting the immigrant population in place early on, and we have gradually refined these efforts as we have gained experience and acquired more knowledge. We have learned a great deal about communication and various ways of reaching different groups in society. An interministerial project has been established to ensure that we learn from this so that when the next crisis strikes, we are better prepared to provide information quickly to the whole population, including all segments of the immigrant population. Even though we have managed to keep society open to a greater degree than many other countries, the pandemic has taken its toll. As the Commission writes, the pandemic has affected everyone, but the effects have varied.  The Government has attached importance to ensuring proportionality between the infection situation and the measures implemented. We have introduced compensatory measures where possible. And we must not forget that the alternative to imposing restrictions would not have been to carry on as normal. We have seen in other countries that once the spread of infection gets out of control, drastic measures are needed to manage the situation.  As the Commission points out, it is too early to draw conclusions about the long-term effects of the pandemic. The long-term impacts will also be affected by the political choices we have made and will make in the time ahead.  The Government’s aim is to ensure that no one is left to deal with problems caused by the pandemic on their own. We have tackled this crisis together. And if we are to achieve our aim, we must come out of the crisis together as well. Some people will have to cope with the ramifications for longer than others. Some will have fallen behind at school. Some children will be dealing with the after-effects of violence in the home. Some people will have mental health problems. Some will have health problems following COVID-19 or other illness. Others will have problems finding a job. In my address to the Storting on 7 April, I described the Government’s plans to ensure that no one is left to deal with problems caused by the pandemic alone, and to minimise the long-term effects of the COVID-19 crisis.  In the revised budget, which will be presented soon, the Government will further strengthen these efforts, for example by proposing allocations for new measures to improve the situation of vulnerable children and young people. We will also continue to work to ensure that those who have missed out on education and training receive the support they need. We will also implement measures to prevent students from dropping out or delaying their studies. In the revised budget, we will also follow up the report of the expert group appointed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on mental health and substance abuse.  We also need better knowledge about the long-term effects of the pandemic. We can acquire this through more research. The Government will therefore propose funding for this in the revised budget.  Conclusion Madam President, I would like to thank the Coronavirus Commission for its constructive and thorough report. The report contains 17 central conclusions and 63 lessons and recommendations. The Government will use the report in its ongoing efforts to manage the pandemic, and not least in its work to prepare Norway for future crises. The report provides a good basis for this. The Government will also circulate the Commission’s report for comment.  But we are still in the midst of a crisis. There are still some 200 people admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19. Last week, nearly 3 000 new cases were registered. This spring, a new more infectious variant of the virus has emerged, and we have seen from other countries that the number of cases can suddenly skyrocket. At the same time, more and more people have been vaccinated. Nearly 1.2 million Norwegians have received at least one dose.  Against this backdrop, the Government has asked the Commission to continue its work and draw up a final report. Managing the crisis is still our top priority. The Commission’s work so far will be very useful to us.  Some of the Commission’s recommendations involve major, far-reaching changes. We will have to take steps to address these when the pandemic is over. As I have already mentioned, the Government intends to present a white paper after the Commission delivers its final report. In the white paper, the Government will present its own assessments and proposals for follow-up action to ensure that Norway is better equipped to respond to pandemics in the future.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/report-of-the-coronavirus-commission/id2846054/"
"29"," Norway's statement at the United Nations General Assembly ",2021-09-23,"President, We know the path we need to take – and we have a plan: The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are the roadmap to the world we want. Let me start with climate change. We are already living with the impacts. Just ask the many people who have witnessed devastating famine, floods and forest fires. Together, we will work to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, in line with the goal of the Paris Agreement. The transition to a low-emission society will require profound change. But it will also create opportunities for employment and growth. To ensure a fair and just transition, we must cut emissions – not jobs. We must invest in renewables and new technology. We must put a price on carbon. Investors and businesses will rise to the challenge once the right incentives are in place. Many countries have enhanced their targets. More countries, especially large economies, need to raise their ambition level ahead of COP26. We are doing our part. Norway's new target is to cut emissions by at least 50 % - and towards 55 % - by 2030. We will also continue to partner with developing countries in their efforts to achieve climate-resilient and sustainable development. President, To tackle climate change, we urgently need to restore the health of the ocean. Healthy and productive oceans can help us achieve the SDGs. We know what has to be done. The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy has presented an ambitious action agenda. This should form the basis for discussions on the oceans moving forward. Effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity must go hand in hand. Without healthy oceans, we all face an uncertain future.  The Ocean Panel members have made a commitment to sustainably manage all of their ocean areas by 2025. That is one third of the world´s exclusive economic zones. This is a bold target. But our ambition is even bolder: We call on all ocean and coastal states to make a similar commitment by 2030. President, The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us – yet again – that global problems require global solutions. It has also shown us what we can achieve together: effective vaccines developed in record time. We must not stop there: We need to reform and strengthen the global health architecture to prevent, detect, and respond to future threats. And we need a fully financed WHO playing a central, coordinating role. We must invest in health. We must build robust national health systems and ensure universal health coverage. There is a glaring inequity in vaccine distribution. Some countries have vaccinated their populations, and are on the path to recovery. For others, the lack of vaccines and weak health systems pose a serious problem. In Africa, fewer than 1 in 20 people are fully vaccinated. In Europe, one in two are fully vaccinated. This inequity is clearly unfair. In some countries, the mindset seems to be that the pandemic is over – whilst others are facing huge waves of infection. The result is a disconnected world. It is unacceptable and dangerous. The truth is: The pandemic is not over, and it will not be over anywhere until it’s over everywhere. We need to accelerate the vaccination rollout across the world. Norway is proud to co-chair the ACT-Accelerator. It was set up to promote equitable access to tests, treatments, and vaccines. Public-private partnerships such as CEPI and Gavi are also part of the solution. Let us all agree: Financing pandemic preparedness is a sound investment – and we all benefit from the returns.  We need to finance a sustainable recovery. We have an opportunity to do things right: We must align our efforts with our roadmap, the 2030 Agenda. We must invest in the green transition. We must invest in people, women and girls in particular. And we must fulfil the promise of the SDGs, to leave no one behind. We must secure the future welfare of a rapidly growing population. Domestic resource mobilisation is crucial to build back better and to reach the SDGs. Fair and effective tax systems are needed – not only to generate revenue, but also to build trust in government. The agreement reached in the OECD on a new framework for international tax reform is an important step forward. Without global trade and investments, we cannot solve the challenges we are facing. This will require job creation, openness, rules-based trade and fewer trade barriers. Free trade creates win-win solutions. Protectionism does not. President, Respect for human rights is essential to build prosperous and free societies. It is also the basis for equitable and stable societies. Everyone who believes in democracy must now defend its core values. On a personal note, I stand here as a Prime Minister who lost an election last week. After eight years, my Government will step down and hand over to a new team. I hope they will succeed in taking our country forward. I am mentioning this because orderly transitions cannot be taken for granted. And because democracy at work can help reduce the mistrust in and between countries. The kind of mistrust that the Secretary-General points to in ‘Our Common Agenda’. The decline in democracy and respect for human rights should be of concern to us all. We are seeing grave human rights violations in many parts of the world. In Venezuela. The atrocities and conflict in Tigray. The deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation in Myanmar, including for the Rohingyas. To mention a few. We count on the Security Council and regional organisations to play a proactive role. And we are alarmed and saddened by recent developments in Afghanistan. In the past two decades, Afghans have seen a significant progress in the human rights situation. Health care systems have been improved and millions of children have received an education. These hard-won gains must be protected. We are now particularly concerned about the rights of women and girls, and people belonging to religious, ethnic, sexual and gender minorities. We fear for those who are at risk because of their work to advance fundamental freedoms. We will continue to support them, and the rest of the Afghan people. We will judge the Taliban by their actions, not but by their words. The composition of the interim government is discouraging. President, Global challenges have a major impact on international peace and security. Twice this year, the Security Council has discussed the security implications of climate change. To reach the SDGs, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are vital. We must safeguard and strengthen the norms and structures that maintain peace. We must make sure that progress in this area is not reversed. We need to protect and promote the framework for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation – first and foremost, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Great power rivalry can threaten strategic stability. Dialogue and cooperation are essential. The extension of the New START Treaty is a welcome step forward. The international norm against the use of weapons of mass destruction must be upheld. The increased threat from chemical weapons must be countered. President, Durable peace is crucial to long-term security. In our work in the Security Council, we promote dialogue, partnerships, and preventive diplomacy. To remain relevant, the Council must respond to threats to international peace and security. It must not shy away from challenging situations. The adoption of the resolution extending the mandate for delivering cross-border humanitarian aid into Syria was encouraging. It offers hope of finding a political solution to the long-lasting conflict. UN peace operations play a key role throughout the world. Norway is a strong supporter of the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative. This includes financial support to enhance the capacity of UN peace operations to carry out their mandate. Especially their mandate to facilitate political processes, protect civilians and implement the women, peace, and security agenda. Another challenge is maritime security and piracy. We need an integrated global response to make the oceans safe. Some 90 % of piracy incidents take place in the Gulf of Guinea. Norway is seeking to advance this issue in the Security Council, in close cooperation with the countries in the region. President, In closing, I would like to commend the Secretary-General for the realistic assessment he presents in ‘Our Common Agenda’. We are given a choice between breakdown and breakthrough. I remain optimistic. We must take the crises we are now facing as our call to action. We must focus all there is to gain from acting together. There is a way forward. We have already charted our course; the 2030 agenda is our roadmap. Let´s not hesitate. Let’s join forces and get started right away. Thank you.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/norways-statement-at-the-united-nations-general-assembly/id2872363/"
"30"," Prime Minister’s statement regarding the handling of the coronavirus pandemic ",2021-01-19,"President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address the status and handling of the coronavirus outbreak. As I wrote in a letter to the Presidium of the Storting on 27 October, the Norwegian Government wishes to keep the Storting abreast regarding the coronavirus situation. On this basis, before Christmas, the Minister of Health and Care Services requested to address the work regarding the coronavirus pandemic. I have understood that there is also a desire for a more comprehensive briefing. Following my statement, the Minister of Health and Care Services will provide a briefing regarding the work on vaccines.  A year has now passed since China reported the discovery of a new virus that would come to change all of our everyday lives. Norway quickly put in place diagnostics that could detect the virus, and the first case of Covid-19 in Norway was confirmed on 26 February. Since that day, 3.1 million tests have been performed, 58,000 individuals have had a confirmed case of the virus, nearly 2300 individuals have been admitted to hospital and 517 individuals have perished. In Norway, we have managed to keep the infection numbers lower than in many other countries, but we have also had to tighten restrictions in order to avoid the situation getting out of control. We continue to have the infection under control, but we have no guarantees that this will last. The situation can change quickly. Immunisation is fully underway, but we do not yet know the extent to which it protects against transmission of the virus to other people. In any case, it will be some time before enough people are immunised for this to have a considerable impact on the spread of infection. In many countries, the third wave of infections is described as the worst yet in the pandemic. Societies are locked down and hospitals are filled to capacity. As opposed to this autumn, schools in many countries are also closing. What is happening abroad could also happen here. We are regularly witnessing how fragile the infection situation can be. A few weeks ago, Ireland went from having some of the lowest infection rates in Europe to being at the top of the statistics. When the surge comes, it can come very quickly. We saw this in Trondheim as well. Early in December, there was a desire for exemptions from the national infection control measures due to low rates of infection. A few weeks later, they were forced to tighten restrictions by imposing local measures. In the final two weeks of last year, Trøndelag County had the highest rate of infection in the country. This underlines the importance of acting quickly in response to indications of increased spread of infection. It is easier to scale back strict measures than to halt an outbreak that gets out of control. Once the infection is out of control, the measures will have to be even more intrusive and last even longer. Therefore, it is important to act quickly. The mutated variants of the virus make the situation even more vulnerable. Mutated viruses from the United Kingdom and South Africa have also found their way to Norway and we have seen other mutations in Norwegian outbreaks. We are following the spread of the more infectious viruses closely, both in Norway and abroad. We must always be prepared to introduce even stronger measures to stop the spread of infection. At the same time, we do not want measures that are more intrusive than necessary. The handling of Covid-19 is a challenging balancing act, and we must continuously make trade-offs. We must adjust measures in light of new knowledge and act quickly to make adjustments when this is necessary. Throughout the crisis, we have attempted to strike a balance between what are proportionate interventions in light of the infection situation and taking a precautionary approach and acting quickly enough. This is no easy task. A measure may be disproportionate early in the week because the infection numbers are uncertain and proportionate later in the week because we are then able to determine that the rate of infection is increasing. Striking the right balance and avoiding the imposition of highly intrusive measures before there are grounds for doing so may also entail that we have to act quickly when we are advised to tighten the measures. If we are too late to act, the outcome will be even more intrusive and longer measures, next time. The Norwegian Government has therefore throughout this period clearly stated that tightening of restrictions may occur quickly. How the advice can change was clearly shown over the Christmas holidays. Before Christmas, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health assessed that there were no grounds for tightened measures during Christmas. On 29 December, the Norwegian Directorate of Health reported that there was still no need to tighten measures, but that they would make a new assessment in the beginning of January. Then, during the first days of the new year, the situation became more unstable and unpredictable. The R number was then estimated to be 1.3. Up from 0.8 in the beginning of December and 1.0 just before Christmas.  Early Saturday morning on 2 January, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Directorate of Health reported concerns regarding the infection numbers and advised tightening of restrictions at 18:00 the same evening. The Norwegian Government immediately followed up. At a press conference on Sunday 3 January, I asked everyone to participate in a joint effort to avoid a new wave of infection. We began 2021 by asking the population to put their social lives on hold. We feared that the new year would begin with a new wave. Among other measures introduced were a national ban on the serving of alcohol, universities, university colleges and vocational schools transitioned to digital instruction and upper and lower secondary schools had to escalate to a red level. We recommended that people avoid non-essential travel both internationally and within Norway, and we asked people to avoid all private visits and organised activities indoors. Measures for students were quickly clarified and communicated already on Saturday. These are strict and intrusive measures. Unfortunately, they were necessary to be certain that the infection did not get out of control, and to prevent a dramatic increase in hospital admissions – as we have seen in several places in Europe. Unfortunately, our fears were confirmed by the infection numbers published in week 1. In the first week of 2021, we experienced the highest number of positive tests to date in the pandemic. The R number was then estimated at 1.4. Today, I am pleased to announce that people throughout Norway participated in this joint effort. This is impressive following almost a year of infection control measures. In the Norwegian Directorate of Health’s survey on the coronavirus, we see that many people have put their social lives on hold. People state that their number of close contacts is lower than before. The survey also shows that the population is observing the recommendation to maintain physical distancing. We are now seeing the first signs of efforts at the start of January paying dividends in terms of the spread of infection, even though it is too early to evaluate the full effects thereof. The numbers continue to be too high and the concerns regarding the mutated virus have not been assuaged.  Therefore, the Norwegian Government has now decided to maintain an elevated national level of measures. At the same time, we are making some adjustments. The goal of these adjustments is to make the everyday lives of children and young people a little more normal. I emphasise that these are national measures. In municipalities with high rates of infection, the municipality may have imposed stricter measures. If so, it is the municipal measures that apply. The national level of measures for lower and upper secondary schools is downgraded from red to yellow. The municipalities may maintain a red level through this week if they need to prepare the transition. However, municipalities with high rates of infection should consider maintaining the red level in lower and upper secondary schools, and, if needed, also return to a red level in day-care facilities and primary schools.  Otherwise, the national recommendations from 20 January will be as follows: We are largely continuing the measures from the turn of the year. In somewhat easing certain measures nationally, the Norwegian Government has chosen to prioritise children and young people. This has been one of our most important prioritisations throughout the pandemic. One measure that many have experienced as intrusive is the ban on the serving of alcohol. For many, this entails a loss of revenue and layoffs. For others, it means a loss of a cherished meeting place. In light of the uncertain infection situation, we have chosen to extend this measure. We know that employees in the hospitality industry are significantly overrepresented in terms of coronavirus infection. In a recently published report by a Danish expert group, it was assessed that bars are among the areas that have the highest impact of the spread of infection. We are now all tired of the coronavirus. However, we are seeing that we continue to be capable of halting the spread of infection when this is necessary. This is good. Because the threat is not over yet. We must be prepared to introduce new and stricter measures if this becomes necessary. The Norwegian Government has launched a consultation process regarding an addition to the Norwegian Act Relating to the Control of Communicable Diseases that regulates curfews. No one wants a curfew in Norway. However, if infection gets out of control, entailing that the lives and health of many people are seriously threatened, this may be the last resort at our disposal. We have seen that this has happened in several countries around us. Therefore, the Norwegian Government has determined that necessary preparations should be made, so that a curfew may be introduced within regulated and predictable frameworks, should this become necessary. However, I must repeat: We hope and believe that this will not happen. And we are working hard to prevent it. However, emergency preparedness is about also being prepared for situations we do not want to experience. I can assure everyone that all measures are being considered and weighed against the unwanted consequences that may arise when measures are introduced. The measures shall be as targeted and effective as possible and with the fewest possible negative consequences. At the same time, it is important to clearly state that the alternative to infection control measures is not normal everyday life. The alternative is hospitals at capacity, high numbers of fatalities and more serious economic implications. Experiences from other countries show that a lot is required in order to reduce infection once it has become established at a high level. Therefore, we will do what is necessary to keep infection under control. People must be prepared to live with varying degrees of infection and infection control measures until the summer, perhaps even longer. At the same time, the measures must not be stricter than they need to be, and we will ease restrictions as quickly and as soon as this is sound. President, Throughout the pandemic, the Norwegian Government has been concerned about import infection. Already from mid-March last year, quarantine and a ban on entry to Norway were introduced. Since then, there have been many adjustments, both out of consideration for families who want to be together and people who need to get to work, but also to contain import infection.  In limiting how many people we allow into our country; various considerations must be weighed against one another. Striking the right balance is challenging. The impact on health must be weighed against the clear negative consequences caused by the measures. For families who are unable to see each other. For hotels that remain vacant. For public and private enterprises that are unable to obtain the labour their depend on. Whether we like it or not, our society is entirely dependent on foreign labour. We are dependent on importing and exporting goods. The Norwegian Government has been concerned with keeping the wheels turning. It is also important that our society be able to maintain the measures until the population has been immunised. Therefore, trade-offs have been made between costs and benefits throughout. For instance, we have kept the supply lines open. The hospitals have had access for foreign labour as usual, so that people who become sick may receive treatment but with added precautions. The agricultural sector has been able to use seasonal labour, so that they could sow and harvest food. The same applies to the fisheries, enabling the implementation of winter fishing, on which many district communities are entirely dependent to maintain settlements. Shipyards along the coast have been able to use the labour they are accustomed to, so that they can fulfil the contracts they have entered into. The same applies to many other industries. Many jobs would have been lost had we closed the borders entirely. Throughout, the Norwegian Government has had rules to limit the number of people arriving. There have also been rules for detecting infection and avoiding infection throughout. These rules have changed according to the infection situation in Norway and in the countries from which people are arriving. Last summer, many countries were green. At the time, there was little risk, and the rules were less strict. Once the infection situation in Europe changed last autumn, the Norwegian Government acted, and we have continuously introduced new measures to avoid import infection and prevent the spread of infection in Norway. On 31 October, we tightened the rules for persons travelling for work purposes. When I addressed the Storting on 5 November last year, I informed that the Norwegian Government was introducing a quarantine hotel scheme. Such hotels are now established in all counties. The county governors are responsible for ensuring that there is at all times sufficient capacity in the county. From 9 November, requirements were introduced that travellers from countries subject to a duty to quarantine must present a certificate of a negative Covid-19 test when they arrive in Norway. The Norwegian Government also took immediate action over the Christmas holidays to avoid the spread of the virus variant detected in the United Kingdom to the greatest extent possible. Currently, it does not appear that the mutation has gained a foothold here. We have seen in other countries that it has been challenging to prevent the virus from establishing itself. However, it is also important to gain time. If we gain enough time, immunisation and hopefully also the summer heat will help us. By Easter, a larger share of the high-risk groups will be immunised. The threat posed by the mutated viruses were a contributing factor to the Norwegian Government on 2 January imposing a duty to be tested for Covid-19 for all persons arriving in Norway. In order to give the municipalities time to build testing capacity, we allowed for the test to be taken no later than one day after arrival. We requested the relevant border municipalities to build sufficient capacity as soon as possible to handle everyone arriving in the country at the relevant border crossings. We have also introduced an entry register. This will make it easier to follow-up and monitor compliance with the duty to quarantine. As of today, we are further tightening the rule regarding testing upon arrival in the country. Now, all travellers must be tested at the border. The exception is Svinesund, where the municipality requires a few more days to establish sufficient testing capacity. Exemptions may still be granted there, so that those with permanent residence in Norway may enter with a duty to be tested within 24 hours. In order to assist the municipalities, the Norwegian Directorate of Health has been tasked with establishing a national call centre that will follow-up travellers. Employees at the centre shall be capable to communicating in multiple languages as some travellers do not speak the Scandinavian languages or English. This will make it easier for the municipalities to monitor whether or not travellers have been tested and undergone quarantine, thereby easing the burden on the municipalities. All expenses for testing and monitoring activities regarding whether or not travellers have actually taken a coronavirus test will be covered. Those who do not subject to testing risk fines. Persons with false certificates of a negative Covid-19 test may be expelled and fined. President, If we compare Norway to the rest of Europe, we have consistently been among the countries with the very strictest rules regarding entry and quarantine. In overviews of what types of measures the populations of various countries are subject to, we see that Norwegians have fewer restrictions in their everyday lives. I believe this has been an appropriate prioritisation. The strict entry rules we currently have also contribute to relieving the burden on the municipalities. However, they also represent a significant burden on the municipalities with border crossings, airports and ports, even though the state is covering all costs. President, There has been a lot of discussion regarding testing at the borders. The Norwegian Directorate of Health’s clear advice to the Norwegian Government has until recently been to prioritise testing capacity in order to halt local outbreaks in Norway. It is also important to remember that quarantine, if it is undergone, is the only thing that guarantees avoiding the spread of infection. Experiences from Iceland show that approximately 25 per cent of those who were infected were not detected by the test that was taken at the border. There are mainly two reasons why the situation has now changed, and the Norwegian Directorate of Health is now recommending testing at the border. One reason is the desire to delay the spread of the more infectious variants of the virus to the greatest extent possible. The other reason is access to rapid testing. They increase our overall testing capacity. In addition, the rapid tests enable the commencement of isolation immediately following a positive test result. These test also do not require laboratory capacity. However, I must once again stress that the most important measure is entry quarantine and that this be undergone in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the Norwegian Government has also implemented a number of follow-up measures in this regard. The municipalities are under considerable pressure. They must test and conduct contact tracing, they must ensure that all persons who test positive isolate, and they must contribute to the notification of close contacts of the infected person, so that they can undergo quarantine. The municipalities are also tasked with immunising their residents. At the same time, the municipalities must perform ordinary health and care services and safeguard the services for vulnerable groups, include vulnerable children and young people. The municipalities must also conduct monitoring of whether the rules regarding events, food and drinks establishments and employees are observed. This is also a task that must be prioritised. Succeeding in immunisation is the highest priority going forward. The municipalities must have the capacity and resources for the major immunisation effort ahead of them. Therefore, we must all contribute to preventing resource-consuming outbreaks and reducing infection among the population. Amid a challenging situation, I also wish to encourage the municipalities to cooperate and assist one another. The county governors have an important role in contributing to cooperation between the municipalities, including regarding immunisation, which has now commenced nationwide. In the last two months, the number of hospitalisations and the number of patients who have received ventilator treatment has remained fairly stable, although we have seen a moderate increase in the latter. However, we know this can change quickly. Fortunately, we are now better prepared for an increase in seriously ill Covid-19 patients than we were last spring. The hospitals are monitoring the development in infection numbers closely and can adapt their capacity if the patient flow increases. We have good access to personal protective equipment and medical-technical equipment. Plans have also been made to face a situation where we need to rapidly mobilise for a much higher intensive care capacity. We also know more about the disease and have become better at treating patients. However, we do not want to find ourselves in such a situation. This would entail that other planned treatment would have to be postponed in order to be able to care for Covid-19 patients. Furthermore, we are still not able to save the lives of all those who develop serious disease. The economic development President, Compared to other countries, Norway is currently expected emerge favourably both in terms of health and the economy, as assessed by the OECD, among others. However, we are also experiencing major losses and the situation is fragile. We are projected to experience a decline in Mainland GDP for 2020 of approximately three per cent. This is less than most other countries in the world. The decline is approximately as forecast in the National Budget, but less than we expected in May, when we estimated a decline of between four to eight per cent. The fact that the decline has not been larger must be viewed in light of the following: The GPD figure shows the overall situation. Bigger differences are hidden behind the macro figures. The crisis has had very different impacts on the private sector. Service industries such as tourism, restaurants and transport amount to ten per cent of the Norwegian economy, and activities in these industries were in November 25 per cent below the level they were at just before the pandemic commenced. These industries have a greater share of employment than of the GDP, with one sixth of all Norwegian jobs. At the same time, 90 per cent of the Norwegian economy has an unchanged value creation compared to February of last year. This relatively positive development for this part of the private sector must be viewed, among other things, in light of the measures that have been implemented. The financial packages of measures are effective and are resulting in lower unemployment than we would otherwise be experiencing. For instance, it appears that the temporary taxation changes for the oil and gas industry have had a positive effect. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s current estimates indicate an annual investment level in the coming years that will result in a higher level of activity than estimated prior to the commencement of the pandemic. This generates jobs on the mainland and contributes to technology development and competence in the supplier industry. Companies with a high need for foreign labour, such as in the building and construction and shipyard industries, and thereby high expenses associated with quarantine, have also received support to cover such expenses. Many are benefit from having a permanent job and the low interest rate and are saving money because of fewer spending options. Other employees have been laid off and are experiencing uncertainty, insecurity and weakened finances. Focus has been and must also continue to be on those worst affected. I am especially concerned about long-term unemployment, for young people, persons experiencing loneliness and those with a weak connection to the labour market. We have also presented targeted measures in this regard. Among other things, we have presented a package of measures amounting to nearly NOK 160 million, directed at vulnerable groups and individuals who are affected by loneliness and isolation. In the budget settlement, we agreed on NOK 400 million in earmarked grants to activity measures and countering loneliness for the elderly. This is in addition to increased efforts on inclusion, education and measures directed at children.  We will continue to focus on vulnerable groups and are currently working on new measures for both persons who are unemployed long-term and vulnerable children and young people. For the Norwegian economy, 2021 will probably, and hopefully, be a year filled with major differences. The start of the year is strongly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment is higher than usual, there are a lot of closures and activity is reduced. However, things are clearly better than they were last spring. This is because the infection control measures are less intrusive, and companies have learned how they can adapt costs and operations to the situation. The Norwegian private sector is also benefitting from a higher oil price and increased demand from abroad. Over the course of the year, we are expecting that the immunisation programme will counter the pandemic, and that we can return to some degree of normalcy in our everyday lives. The Norwegian Government’s overall strategy for reopening therefore remains unchanged. We know that the most important contribution to activity, employment and growth in the service industries is that the strict measures cease to apply. Then, people will once again be able travel, work, enjoy nightlife and return to normalcy. Therefore, we are implementing strict measures in light of the infection control situation and are implementing a comprehensive immunisation programme.  We know that many people have saved a lot more money than usual during the pandemic. This means that many people have money to spend once the pandemic is over and this will contribute to increased economic growth. In many forecasts, it is estimated that the Norwegian economy will grow more in 2021 than just a short time ago. Continued need for economic measures Even though we are now hopefully seeing the end of the pandemic on the horizon, we must expect to continue living with varying degrees of infection and infection control measures until the summer. And perhaps even longer. Significant uncertainties remain regarding future developments. I have also said that we must expect a higher number of bankruptcies. Paradoxically, the number of bankruptcies was lower than usual last year. We assume that the sum of the economic measures, including deferred taxes and charges have contributed to this, but we must be prepared for an increase in the number of bankruptcies. Since March, the Norwegian Government has been stating that we will have economic measures in place for as long as we have infection control measures. We have also shown throughout 2020 that we are continuously following up with measures as the situation develops. This offers predictability. With the agreement with the Norwegian Progress Party (FrP) regarding the National Budget for 2021, the Storting adopted a number of economic measures pertaining to the pandemic just a few weeks ago. These funds are now being put to work.  However, we have also said that the economic measures must be adapted to the infection situation and what infection control measures we have available. This is still the case and will perhaps become even more important as we near the end of the pandemic.  The Norwegian Government will maintain the compensation scheme and other compensatory measures for as long as this is appropriate and necessary, but as soon as the possibilities are there, economic policy must encourage activity and adaptation. This applies to both companies and individuals. This, too, is a balancing act. Often it is not a case of the more the merrier. Measures that may be convenient in the short term, may weaken the economy in the long term, as many economists suggested already at an early stage of the pandemic. If we uncritically allocate too much to too many over a long period, this will weaken growth, jobs and adaptation in the long-term. This is not primarily about saving money for the public sector. It is about generating the basis for new jobs, increased activity and increased welfare. And preventing those most vulnerable on the labour market from becoming marginalised. The Norwegian Government’s message of creating more and including more people also applies here. The goal is for as many laid-off individuals as possible to return to work. However, not all companies will survive, and individual employees must therefore have to consider how best to approach the future. The longer you are unemployed, the harder it becomes to return to work. Individuals who are laid off must therefore grab new job opportunities when they come along. This is also the background as to why the Norwegian Government believes it is appropriate to be cautious in extending the furlough scheme too far into the future. At the same time, already in early December in the Storting, the Minister of Finance opened for possibility that the Norwegian Government would consider an extension of the furlough scheme in light of the situation.  I am of the opinion that our ongoing handling, the measures that are currently effective and those we are proposing, offer the private sector as much predictability as possible. Unpredictability is precisely part of what has characterised the pandemic. However, predictability is not the same as making the measures permanent, with the same approach over an extended period, irrespective of the infection control measures. Predictability is about having economic measures adapted to the infection situation. Compared to the countries around us, the Norwegian private sector enjoys good schemes that been put in place quickly. Our companies can be confident going forward that the Norwegian Government will do what is needed in order for us to make it out of this crisis in the best possible manner. Here, I would also like to refer to the good cooperation in the Storting through many and extraordinary rounds of economic measures. This will also be important throughout 2021. Safeguarding our companies is important in order for the growth of the economy to be able to resume as quickly as possible once infection control measures are eased, so that as many as possible have a job to go to after the crisis. In December, the Norwegian Government received support in the Storting to re-establish a broad compensation scheme for the private sector. Since 08:00 today, the Brønnøysund Register Centre has been receiving applications for compensation. The majority of the companies that are now applying will receive funds very quickly.  We have already publicly announced that we will extend the compensation scheme for the private sector up to and including April, and the Norwegian Government is prepared to extend this scheme further if this becomes necessary. We have also submitted a proposal to extend the furlough scheme and the temporary scheme of increased unemployment benefits until the summer. The private sector is also covered by a number of other schemes, and the Norwegian Government is working on several other measures going forward. These will be presented in a Proposition to the Storting on 29 January. Measures that can enhance the competitiveness of companies and competence of individuals are of particular importance. As infection control measures are gradually removed and support schemes are scaled back, it is likely that much of the activity in the economy will return, as many will once again attend the cinema, dine out and take weekend trips. We will benefit from having kept businesses afloat, and from having stimulated education, adaptation and competence enhancement. Should there be a need for additional economic stimulus measures, this must be considered after infection control measures have been removed. Once activity returns to a more normal level of activity, use of funds from the Government Pension Fund of Norway will also have to be reduced and replaced by new activity in the private sector. Conclusion President, Many were looking forward to 2021 with hope and expectation. So far, the year has been a disappointment for many. But we will not give up on 2021.  There is light at the end of the tunnel. Immunisation is underway. But we must persist. When the Norwegian Government today continues strict national measures for at least another two weeks, this is occurring with a different backdrop than what many of the countries around us are experiencing. The situation globally and in Europe serves as a warning of what could happen if we do not succeed in containing infection. My colleagues internationally are facing challenging dilemmas with a very high and increased infection rate, health services at the breaking point and extremely high numbers of fatalities. Curfews and very intrusive measures are being extended in many countries. With our backs against the wall, our room for manoeuvre diminishes. We do not want to experience this. We are now at the beginning of the end of a long and painful marathon. Immunisation is underway. But the last stage may be the most difficult. People are tired, new variants of the virus may present us with steep climbs, and infection in communities remains high. With a joint effort going forward, we can reduce infection so that the winter and spring will become a bit brighter for all of us. After with each passing week, we are one week closer to having immunised enough people to take back our everyday lives.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/prime-ministers-statement-regarding-the-handling-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/id2828866/"
"31"," The Prime Minister’s Opening Remarks at the press conference on 12 May ",2021-05-18,"Dear everyone, So far, more than 1.5 million Norwegians have received at least one vaccine dose. Approximately half a million of these people are fully vaccinated. If vaccination continues according to plan, everyone over the age of 18 will have been offered their first dose by early August. ""Vaccines are one of our most important weapons in the fight against COVID-19. They can give us our everyday lives back. And greater freedom. This press conference will address: Young people prioritised In the first part of the vaccination programme, we will prioritise the risk groups, those over 45 and health workers. We believe that we made the right decision, and have stood by it, even though many other prioritisation strategies have been suggested. As we move to the second part of the vaccination programme, the Norwegian Government has decided the following: The Norwegian Government is moving young people ahead in the vaccine queue, among other reasons because: The Norwegian Government’s decision is in line with advice from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Even though there is no great impact in terms of lives and health, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health nonetheless believes that the vaccines will be most effective if we prioritise the age groups 18 to 24 and 40 to 44 once we are done vaccinating people over 45. They point out that people aged 40– 44 have a slightly higher risk of falling seriously ill, but also that people aged 18– 25 have a higher risk of becoming infected. For the Norwegian Government, the decisive factor is that this combination is most effective overall. This will allow us to gradually reopen society more quickly. Geographical redistribution The Norwegian Government has decided to allow greater geographical redistribution subject to certain conditions. The pandemic has hit some people harder than others. Some municipalities have barely seen any infection. In other parts of the country, COVID-19 has become deep-rooted, and people have lived with extremely strict measures in place over a long period of time. Consequently, the Norwegian Government has also asked the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to reassess the geographical distribution. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health believes that slightly fewer people will become seriously ill if we give a larger fraction of the vaccines to the 24 municipalities in Eastern Norway that have had a high rate of infection over time. They believe that such a redistribution will, to a greater extent, allow us to ease measures simultaneously throughout the country. This means that the municipalities in central Eastern Norway, which have had to endure the longest with strict measures, will not also have them the longest through spring and summer. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommends that these municipalities receive 80 per cent more doses than originally planned until all people over the age of 18 have received their first dose of the vaccine. The proposal means that 319 municipalities will have to relinquish 40 to 50 per cent of their doses in June, while there will be no changes for 13 municipalities. Among the municipalities that will relinquish doses, according to the recommendations of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, there are municipalities which have lately suffered major outbreaks. This means we have had to carefully consider our options. The proposed redistribution will not have a great impact on infection and mortality rates. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health believes that fewer people will become seriously ill. In the main, the Norwegian Government wishes to follow the advice regarding further geographical redistribution of the vaccines. The most important reason for this is that we believe Norway in its entirety will be able to reopen sooner if we do it this way. We have stood together during this crisis. Our goal is that we also come through it together. But we have had to make difficult decisions.The Norwegian Government is worried that a greater redistribution may impact on the progress of the vaccination programme. The municipalities will receive many doses in the holiday month of July. The municipalities that will receive fewer doses in June, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health’s proposal, will get these back in July. These will come in addition to the doses that they would have received. This raises the question of whether the municipalities will have the capacity to vaccinate so many people in such a short time. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, both 60 and 80 per cent more doses for the 24 municipalities in Eastern Norway would have approximately the same result. The Norwegian Government has decided on 60 per cent. This will reduce the pressure on the other municipalities in July. The Norwegian Government’s decision relies on two important conditions: We must make sure that the municipalities that receive fewer doses in June and in the beginning of July have the capacity to recoup this shortfall at the end of July. We and the County Governors will talk to the municipalities to investigate whether vaccination in July, which is the main holiday month, can go ahead as scheduled. If we are going to change the distribution of vaccines, first we need to be sure that this will not delay the date on which the entire population will have been vaccinated. We have also asked the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Directorate of Health to quickly assess whether the 24 municipalities in Eastern Norway which are on the list of municipalities that will receive more doses are the right ones. The 24 municipalities on the list have had a persistently high rate of infection. We must also consider whether there are other municipalities that should be prioritised or not have to relinquish doses at this time, due to their infection situation. Soon, once these assessments have been made, we will provide concrete information on how the vaccines can be further redistributed. The Norwegian Government has also asked the Norwegian Institute of Public Health if there are specific professions, teachers in particular, that should be prioritised in the vaccine queue. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health does not recommend this. The Norwegian Government agrees. On a national level, the rate of infection among teachers is no higher than in other occupations. In areas where the rate of infection is high, like Oslo, this group has been more exposed to infection. But these areas will receive more vaccines as a result of our prioritising municipalities with a persistently high rate of infection. This will also ensure that teachers and kindergarten staff in these areas are vaccinated sooner. Vaccine deliveries are now stable and satisfactory. Everyone over the age of 18 will probably have been offered vaccination before school starts in August. But if we do not receive vaccines as anticipated in the time ahead, we will consider reprioritising teachers and kindergarten staff. Vaccines offered The Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommends that the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines be withdrawn from the Norwegian vaccination programme. The Norwegian Government asked an expert committee led by Lars Vorland to perform a comprehensive assessment before we made the final decision. The expert committee recommended not using the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines at this stage. It stressed that these are effective vaccines against serious illness and that severe side effects are rare. The reason they nonetheless advise against their use at this stage is that: Consequently, the Norwegian Government has concluded that the AstraZeneca vaccine will be removed permanently from the Norwegian vaccination programme. The Norwegian Government has decided that rollout of the Janssen vaccine in the Norwegian vaccination programme will remain on pause. It will not be removed permanently. We want to build up an emergency stockpile that we can use if the rate of infection increases or deliveries from other vaccine manufacturers are interrupted. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommends this. The Janssen vaccine is being used in the USA and in many European countries. As a result, we will have more knowledge about the vaccine and its side effects in the time ahead. The Janssen vaccine has been approved. Our reason for not using it in the national vaccination programme is that we now have a relatively low rate of infection in the population and good access to other vaccines. In this, Norway holds a unique position. For many countries, the Janssen vaccine will be very important and useful for handling the pandemic. In Norway, our assessment is that the negative consequences of possible side effects are greater than the effects of using it. For many countries, the assessment will have a different outcome. Norway choosing not to use neither the AstraZeneca nor the Janssen vaccines in the national vaccination programme means that Norway may fall slightly behind other European countries in terms of how many we manage to vaccinate in the near future. But our faith in the vaccination programme is strong in Norway, and many people want to be vaccinated. So, even though vaccination will take a little longer here, we are doing well in that a high percentage of the population will be vaccinated. And they will receive vaccines that are highly effective. The national vaccination programme, which includes all adults, will consequently consist of the vaccines from Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna. Voluntary vaccination The Norwegian Government has considered whether people who so wish may receive the Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines on a voluntary basis in order to be vaccinated sooner. The expert committee supports making the Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines available outside the vaccination programme but is divided on how this can be done. Now that we are permanently removing the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Norwegian vaccination programme, it is important that these doses can benefit others as soon as possible. We will keep the Janssen vaccines in an emergency stockpile, and it is a single-dose vaccine, which makes administering it easy. The Norwegian Government has therefore concluded that only the Janssen vaccine can be offered on a voluntary basis outside the vaccination programme in Norway. The Norwegian Government believes that, with proper information and guidance, individuals can decide whether they want to take the risk of using this vaccine, and it thus supports the minority of the committee. Before we make the Janssen vaccine available for voluntary use, several matters must be addressed. Firstly, we will ask the Norwegian Directorate of Health to assess whether there should be any criteria that exclude certain groups from the option of choosing the Janssen vaccine because the risk is too great. Secondly, we must ensure that there is good information about the vaccine so that individuals can make good and informed decisions. Thirdly, we must clarify who will administer the vaccines. People who wish to be vaccinated using the Janssen vaccine will be required to consult their general practitioner first. But the vaccine will not necessarily be administered by their doctor. The Minister of Health will be in contact with this sector to clarify who will administer the vaccines. These questions must be answered before we can offer the Janssen vaccine to those who wish to take it. What we already know is that the Janssen vaccine will also be free. The people who get it will be covered by the patient injury compensation scheme if they experience side effects. The vaccine may only be given on a voluntary basis, following good information and guidance from health personnel. International cooperation We will ensure that the AstraZeneca vaccine doses are put to use in other countries. We will do this in collaboration with the Council of Europe and the EU countries that are covered by the AstraZeneca agreement. The EU's agreement with AstraZeneca and Janssen allows donation of vaccines to other countries. A possible solution is to pass on the vaccine doses through Covax, which is working to ensure that low and middle-income countries also receive vaccines. I am glad that Norway has been invited to the Global Health Summit hosted by the European Commission and the G20 towards the end of next week. There we will work for better distribution of vaccines to other countries. We know that the virus does not care about borders and that new mutations in the summer may threaten the positive trend. As we have stressed time and time again during this pandemic: no one is safe until all the world’s countries are safe. Conclusion Bent often says that we will continue to receive good and bad vaccination news. The news we bring today will without a doubt be received as good news by some and bad news by others, and I understand this perfectly well. The decisions of the Norwegian Government mean that some people will receive the vaccine sooner than they thought, while others will have to wait a little longer. It has been a demanding task to consider the arguments and make these difficult decisions. But I would like to remind you of something I said earlier. We are in this together – and we will come through together.  The decisions made by the Norwegian Government will bring us back to everyday life faster – together.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/statsministerens-innledning-om-vaksinestrategien/id2849503/"
"32"," The Prime Minister’s speech on the coronavirus situation ",2021-03-07,"Good evening everyone, On this same weekend, one year ago, the Holmenkollen Ski Festival was held without any spectators present.  That was the first large-scale event to be affected by COVID-19. At that time, infection levels in Norway were rising.  Many people had brought the infection home with them from the Alps.  On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Friday 12 March marks exactly a year since COVID-19 changed most aspects of how we live. From one day to the next, our everyday lives were turned upside down. Hugs, handshakes and social get-togethers were restricted.  Schools were closed. Borders were closed. Businesses were forced to close.  Concerts, events, sports – all were put on hold. And our streets grew empty and quiet.  Words such as ‘quarantine’, ‘cohort’ and ‘isolation’ became frequently used in our daily speech. Along with ‘hand sanitiser’ and ‘face mask’. One metre. Two metres. We found ourselves in the midst of a pandemic. It brought worry, suffering and loss. We mourn those we have lost. Many have felt scared and apprehensive. About loved ones in a risk group. About being in a risk group themselves. Afraid of losing someone they hold dear. Concerned about their jobs and income. Uncertain, because we have no idea when normal life will return.  And many have felt lonely and isolated. Dreams were shattered. Plans were postponed. Little did we know that, a full year later, this crisis would still not be over. And maybe that was a good thing. It has taken longer than we anticipated. And now we are all tired. Tired of the pandemic.  Tired of restrictions and limitations. Tired of having to stick it out for a little while longer. But that is exactly what we have to do. Infection levels are increasing again. The British variant of the virus is gaining a foothold. So we are not quite out of the woods yet. Some municipalities already have extremely restrictive measures in place. Others are seeing new outbreaks – and need to further tighten restrictions. We have yet another hill to climb. We will probably have to employ stricter national measures before we can ease and ultimately lift restrictions altogether. During the past year, we have had to take major decisions very quickly.  Often in situations fraught with uncertainty.  And we did not get everything right on our first try.  But we have been able to adjust our approach as we have learned more along the way. We have all learned a great deal. Best of all has been to see the many ways that people have been there for each other. As a society, we have proven ourselves capable of tackling this successfully. Journalists from all over the world have been asking how Norway has managed to cope so well with the pandemic. And the answer is you. All of us. Our respect for each other across different age groups. Across our different backgrounds. It makes me very proud. Proud of all of you. I want things to go back to normal just as much as everyone else does. I want to enjoy hugs again. And have a social life. Get back to a daily life where a metre is a unit of measurement, and not the recommended distance between people. People we care about. And we will get there. We will be able to sit close together at a sports event. We will be able to go to the cinema, theatre and concerts together. We will reclaim our festivals, gatherings, celebrations, graduating class parties, and meals together. But we are not there yet, and there is still some distance to go before we are. We are in this together. We are strongest together. And together we will triumph. Norway is in a unique position. Most other countries have been hit far harder than we have – in terms of both health and economic impacts. Things could have been so much worse. We have a resilient economy. The vaccination roll-out is underway. And more vaccines are coming. Before the end of March, we will have received close to 1.2 million vaccine doses.  By the end of April, we may have received twice as many.  In May and June we will be receiving even larger shipments.  It is our hope that all adults will have been offered a vaccine by or in the course of the summer. Norwegian authorities and politicians have for the most part worked together, but have also been willing to discuss different measures and solutions across the traditional dividing lines. Our institutions and enterprises have shown they are robust. They have been sorely tested. So many workers and volunteers have provided expertise and worked tirelessly to help. Young and old alike have shown courage and resourcefulness. They have helped each other. And they have helped the most vulnerable among us.  But most important of all: We have you. All of you. We have each other.  And we have confidence in each other.  Our trust in one another is worth far more than a petroleum fund. And we are tackling this together. We have been tackling this together in this for a year now. Each and every one of you has played a role in helping us to beat the pandemic – together. It has not all been negative – let us bring the positive sides with us as we move forward. Let us all thank each other for our efforts so far. If we can manage to control the spread of infection in March and April, we can bring the R number down below 1. By then, so many of us will be vaccinated that we can take the first steps towards a more normal life again. Let us work together to scale what we hope is the final incline. On the other side is the path back to our lives together. Szanowni zgromadzeni, Rok temu w ten weekend ruszył Festiwal Narciarski w Holmenkollen, ale bez udziału publiczności. Było to pierwsze duże wydarzenie, które uległo zmianie z powodu koronawirusa. W tamtym momencie ilość zakażeń w Norwegii wzrastała. Wiele osób przywiozło wirusa do domu z wyjazdu w Alpy. 11 marca Światowa Organizacja Zdrowia WHO ogłosiła pandemię koronawirusa. W piątek 12 marca minie rok, odkąd koronawirus sprawił, że prawie wszystko się dla nas zmieniło. Z dnia na dzień nasze życie wywróciło się do góry nogami. Uściski, podanie ręki i spotkania towarzyskie – ograniczone. Szkoły zamknięto. Granice zamknięto. Przedsiębiorstwa musiały się zamknąć. Koncerty, wydarzenia, sport – wszystko zostało wstrzymane. Ulice i drogi ucichły. Kwarantanna, kohorta i izolacja stały się słowami powszednimi. Tak samo jak dezynfekcja rąk i maseczka. Jeden metr, dwa metry. Znaleźliśmy się w samym środku pandemii. Stała się ona źródłem zmartwienia, cierpienia i strat. Pozostajemy w głębokim żalu po tych, których straciliśmy. Wielu poznało, czym jest strach.  O kogoś w grupie ryzyka. Przed byciem w grupie ryzyka. Strach przed utratą kogoś. Obawa o miejsce pracy i zarobki. Niepewność, bo nie wiedzieliśmy, kiedy codzienność wróci do normy. Wielu odczuło samotność. Marzenia musiały zaczekać. Marzenia prysły. Skąd mogliśmy wtedy wiedzieć, że ten kryzys, rok później, będzie nadal trwał. Może lepiej, że nie wiedzieliśmy. To trwa dłużej niż sobie wyobrażaliśmy. I wszyscy mamy już dosyć. Pandemii. Ograniczeń. Tego, że musimy jeszcze trochę wytrzymać. Ale musimy. Liczba zakażeń ponownie wzrasta. Brytyjska mutacja zaczyna dominować. Dlatego nie możemy jeszcze zrezygnować z surowych obostrzeń. W niektórych gminach już obowiązują bardzo surowe obostrzenia. W innych gminach pojawiły się ogniska zakażeń i obostrzenia trzeba wprowadzić. Czeka nas droga pod górkę, za którą będzie lżej. Najprawdopodobniej jest to droga surowszych obostrzeń ogólnokrajowych, zanim będziemy mogli je złagodzić, a z czasem zlikwidować. W ostatnim roku decyzje wielkiej wagi były podejmowane na szybko. Często z dużą dozą niepewności. I nie wszystko udawało się za pierwszym razem. W miarę jak zdobywaliśmy wiedzę, mogliśmy się dostosowywać. Wszyscy wiele się nauczyliśmy. Tak dobrze było patrzeć na to, jak ludzie wspierali się nawzajem. Jako społeczeństwo pokazaliśmy się z najlepszej strony. Dziennikarze z całego świata pytają, jak Norwegia, mimo wszystko, tak dobrze przetrwała pandemię. Odpowiedzią jesteście wy. My wszyscy. Wzajemny szacunek bez względu na wiek. Bez względu na pochodzenie. To budzi we mnie dumę. Dumę z was. Jak wszyscy inni, ja też chcę powrócić do normalności. Do uścisków. I życia towarzyskiego. Do codzienności, gdzie metr będzie znów oznaczał jednostkę miary, a nie odstęp między ludźmi. Ludźmi, na których nam zależy. Powrócimy tam. Będziemy siedzieć w ścisku na wydarzeniach sportowych. Będziemy siedzieć razem w kinie, w teatrze, na koncercie. Powrócą festiwale, spotkania, uroczystości, święto abiturientów, bliski kontakt, dni powszednie i świąteczne. Ale zanim tam dotrzemy, czeka nas długa droga. Idziemy nią razem. Wspieramy się. I razem z tego wyjdziemy. Norwegia jest w szczególnej sytuacji. Bardzo wiele krajów ucierpiało bardziej. Znacznie bardziej niż my, zarówno pod względem medycznym jak i ekonomicznym. Mogło być znacznie gorzej. Nasza gospodarka jest silna. Szczepienia trwają. Będzie ich więcej. Przed upływem marca otrzymamy niemal 1,2 miliona dawek szczepionki. Przed końcem kwietnia ta liczba może się zwiększyć ponad dwukrotnie. W maju i czerwcu dostawy będą jeszcze większe. Jest nadzieja, że przed wakacjami lub w ich trakcie, wszystkie osoby dorosłe otrzymają możliwość zaszczepienia się. Mamy władzę i polityków, którzy w przeważającej części zwarli szeregi, ale jednocześnie mieli odwagę poddawać pod dyskusję poszczególne działania i rozwiązania – na wskroś tradycyjnych linii podziałów. Mamy silne instytucje i przedsiębiorstwa. Zostały one wystawione na ciężkie próby. Mamy ogrom kompetencji i zaangażowania ze strony różnych grup zawodowych i wolontariuszy. Mamy odważnych seniorów i fantastyczną młodzież. Którzy wspierali się nawzajem. Co niemniej ważne, byli też wsparciem dla szczególnie narażonych grup. Ale najważniejsze ze wszystkiego jest to: Że mamy was. Wszystkich razem. Mamy siebie. I mamy do siebie zaufanie. Zaufanie, które warte jest wielokrotnie więcej niż jakiś fundusz naftowy. I stoimy ramię w ramię. Stoimy ramię w ramię wobec tej sytuacji już od roku. Każdy z was przyczynił się do tego, że z tej sytuacji wybrniemy – razem. Weźmy ze sobą z tego czasu to, co najlepsze. Podziękujmy sobie nawzajem za dotychczasowe zaangażowanie. Jeśli uda się nam utrzymać kontrolę nad liczbą zarażeń w marcu i kwietniu, uda się nam utrzymać wartość współczynnika R poniżej 1. Wtedy na tyle dużo osób będzie zaszczepionych, że w maju będziemy mogli podjąć pierwsze kroki w kierunku powrotu do normalności. Wejdźmy razem pod tę, miejmy nadzieję ostatnią, górkę. Jesteśmy na drodze powrotnej do codzienności, którą będziemy mogli spędzać razem. Год назад в эти выходные состоялось открытие лыжного фестиваля в Хольменколлене – без публики. Это было первое крупное мероприятие, в проведение которого внёс изменения коронавирус. В тот момент количество заражённых в Норвегии росло. Многие привезли с собой вирус, возвращаясь домой из Альп. 11 марта ВОЗ объявила о пандемии коронавируса. В пятницу 12 марта исполнится год с того момента, как коронавирус почти полностью изменил нашу жизнь. В одночасье всё перевернулось с ног на голову. На дружеские объятия при встрече, рукопожатия и личное общение были наложены ограничения. Закрылись школы. Закрылись границы. Пришлось закрываться предприятиям. Концерты, мероприятия, спорт – всё было поставлено на паузу. На улицах стало тихо. В повседневный лексикон вошли слова карантин, разбивка на группы и изоляция. Предметами обихода стали антисептик для рук и маска. Один метр, два метра. Мы столкнулись с пандемией. Она принесла с собой тревогу, страдания и потери. Мы глубоко скорбим по тем, кого потеряли. Многие испытали страх. За того, кто оказался в группе риска. За то, что сам окажется в ней. Страх кого-то потерять. Тревогу за свои рабочие места и доход. Неуверенность, потому что мы не знали, когда наша жизнь станет прежней. Многие почувствовали себя одинокими. Одни мечты пришлось отложить до лучших дней, другие были разбиты. Тогда мы ещё не знали, что год спустя этот кризис по-прежнему не закончится. Может быть, так было лучше. Он оказался дольше, чем мы рассчитывали. И мы все устали. От пандемии. От ограничений. От того, что нужно подождать ещё чуть-чуть. Но подождать нужно. Количество заболевших снова растёт. Британский штамм встречается всё чаще. Поэтому отменять строгие ограничительные меры рано. Некоторые муниципалитеты уже ввели очень строгие меры. В некоторых произошли вспышки заболевания, сделавшие необходимыми ограничительные меры. Нам нужно преодолеть ещё один рубеж. Вероятно, для этого потребуется усиление общегосударственных ограничительных мер, прежде чем мы сможем ослабить, а затем постепенно отменить их. На протяжении последнего года важные решения принимались в срочном порядке. Часто прогнозировать их результаты было очень трудно. И не всё было сделано верно с первой попытки. Постепенно, получая новые знания, мы смогли вносить поправки. Мы все приобрели много новых знаний. Но приятнее всего было видеть взаимопомощь граждан. Наше общество показало себя с лучшей стороны. Журналисты во всём мире задаются вопросом, почему Норвегия, невзирая ни на что, настолько хорошо справилась с пандемией. Ответ – благодаря вам. Благодаря нам всем. Благодаря уважению друг к другу независимо от возраста. Независимо от происхождения. Я горжусь этим. Горжусь вами. Как и все мы, я хочу вернуться к нормальной жизни. В которой мы можем обнять друг друга при встрече. К живому общению. Туда, где метры означают единицу измерения, а не расстояние между людьми. Где можно будет увидеться с теми, кто нам небезразличен. И мы вернёмся туда. Мы будем сидеть вплотную друг к другу на спортивных трибунах. Мы будем ходить в кино, театр, на концерты вместе. Мы снова сможем посещать фестивали, встречаться, праздновать, отмечать окончание школы, заниматься повседневными делами и отдыхать. Но сначала нам всем нужно сделать последнее усилие. Это наше общее дело. Вместе мы сильнее. И вместе мы это преодолеем. Норвегия находится в привилегированном положении. Очень многие страны пострадали гораздо больше. Гораздо больше нас и с медицинской точки зрения, и с экономической. Всё могло быть гораздо хуже. Наша экономика устойчива. Вакцинация уже началась. И она будет продолжаться. До конца марта мы ожидаем получить почти 1,2 миллиона доз вакцины. До конца апреля это количество может более чем удвоиться. В мае и июне мы ожидаем дополнительного увеличения объёмов поставок. Мы надеемся, что в течение лета или к его концу всё взрослое население получит возможность привиться. Чаще всего власти и политики в нашей стране проявляли солидарность, однако, в то же время не боялись обсуждать различные меры и решения, образуя непривычные коалиции. В нашей стране существуют сильные институты и предприятия. Им пришлось выдержать серьёзную проверку на прочность. Мы можем опираться на обширные знания и энтузиазм специалистов в различных сферах и добровольцев. Наши старики ничего не боятся, а молодёжь замечательна. Они продемонстрировали удивительную взаимопомощь. И, что немаловажно, заботу о наиболее уязвимых группах населения. Но самое главное: У нас есть вы. Все вы. Мы есть друг у друга. И мы доверяем друг другу. И это доверие стоит больше, чем нефтяной фонд. Мы объединили усилия. Совместными усилиями мы прожили этот год. Каждый из вас многое сделал для того, чтобы мы смогли преодолеть это вместе. Давайте запомним лучшее, что подарило нам это время. Давайте поблагодарим друг друга за ту работу, которую мы уже проделали. Если нам удастся сохранить контроль над темпами роста количества заражённых в марте и апреле, мы сможем добиться того, чтобы индекс репродукции не превышал единицы. К тому времени число привитых будет достаточным для того, чтобы уже в мае мы смогли начать возврат к прежней жизни. Давайте вместе преодолеем, будем надеяться, последнее препятствие на нашем пути. Мы встали на путь возврата к нормальной жизни, которой мы снова будем жить вместе.   ልክዕ ቅድሚ ዓመት ከምዛ ሎሚ ቀዳመሰንበት ፈስቲቫል ሺ ሆልመንኰልለን ብዘይ ተዓዘብቲ ክኽፈት ዝዝከር እዩ። ብሰንኪ ኮሮና ምቅይያራት ዝተኻየደሉ ቀዳማይን ዝዓበየን ሃገራዊ እንግዶት ክኸውን ድማ በቒዑ። ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ኩነታት ለብዒ ዛይዱ። ብዙሓት ገያሾ ካብ እምባታት ኣልፕ ንኖርወይ ተለኺፎም ኢዮም መጺኦምና። ብዕለት 11 መጋቢት ድማ ዓለምለኻዊ ውድብ ጥዕና እቲ ሕማም ለበዳ ኢዩ ክብል ኣዊጅዎ።  ጽባሕ ዓርቢ ዕለት 12 መጋቢት፡ ኮሮና ቫይረስ ንህይወት ኩላትና ብምትንካፍ ካብ ዘራኻኽበልና ድሮ ሓደ ዓመት ኰይኑ ኣሎ። ካብ ምዓልቲ ንምዓልቲ እናጸንሐ ኸኣ ምዓልታዊ ህይወት ኩላትና ተገማጢሉ። ምስዓም፡ ምሑቛፍ፡ ሰላምታ ኢድን ማሕበራዊ ምትእኽኻብን - ተደራሪቱ። ቤት ትምህርቲታት ተዓጽዩ። ዶባት ተዓጽዩ። ትካላት እውን ክዓጽዋ ተገዲደን። ባህላዊ ምርኢታት፡ እንግዶታት፡ ስፖርት- ኩሉ ደው ኢሉ። ጐደናታት ይኹኑ መንገድታት እውን ጽሞና ዓሲሉዎም ኢዩ። ውሸባ፡ ጉጅለ-ኮሮናን ግለላን ዝብሃላ ቃላት ሉሙዳት ቃላት ኰይነን። መብከኒ ኢድን መሸፈን ኣፍን ኣፍንጫን እውን ብተመሳሳሊ ከምኡ። ሓደ ሜትሮ፡ ክልተ ሜትሮ። ኣብ ሓያል ለበዳ ተሸሚምና። ሻቕሎት፡ ስቓይን ክሳራታትን ድማ ፈጢሩልና። ብሰሪ ኮሮና ህይወቶም ብዝሓለፉ ድማ ኣብ ዓሚቚ ሓዘን ኢና ዘለና። ፍርሒ ዝኣተወና ውሑዳት ኣይኰናን። ንኣብ ተነካእቲ ጉጅለ ዘሎው ይኹን፡ ንባዕልኻ ኣካል ተነካእቲ ጉጅለ ምዃንን፡ ገለ ካባና ከይፍለዩና ዘይፈራሕና ኣይኰናን። ስራሕና ይኹን ድራር ዕለትና ንከይንስእኖ ተሻቒልና ኢና። ምዓልታዊ ህይወትና ናብ ንቡር መዓስ ከም ዝምለስ ብዘይምፍላጥና ጥርጣረ ኣሕዲርና ኢና። ብዙሓት ጽምዋ ክስመዖም ጸኒሑ ኣሎ።  ሕልምታት ደስኪሉ። ሕልምታት ተሴሮም። እዚ ቅልውላው እዚ -ዓመት ድሕሪ ምኽሳቱ- ክሳብ ሕጂ ይጸንሕ ኣይበልናዮን። ምናልባሽ እውን ንጽቡቕና ከይኰነ ኣይተርፍን። ካብ ዝተጸበናዮ ንላዕሊ ግዜ በሊዑልና። ሕጂ እሞ ኸኣ ኩልና ሰልኲዩና ኢዩ ዘሎ። ለበዳ ኣሰልኲዩና ምድርራት ኣሰልኲዩና ንቕሩብ እዋን ክንጽመም ብምዃና እውን ዘየሰልከየና ኣይኰነን። ኣማራጺ ግና የብልናን። ለብዒ ዳግም እናዓረገ ኢዩ። ባህርዪኡ ዝቐየረ ቫይረስ ብሪጣንያ እናዓብለለ ኢዩ ዝመጽእ ዘሎ። ስለዚ ድማ ምትእትታው ተረርቲ ስጒምቲታት ጌና ኣየብቀዐን ኢዩ ዘሎ። ገለ ገለ ንኡሳን ዞባታት ድሮ ኣዝዮም ተረርቲ ስጒምቲታት ኣተኣታቲየን ኣለዋ። ካልኦት ንኡሳን ዞባታት ከኣ ሕጂ ይላባዕ ኣሎ፡ ስጒምቲታት ከተኣታትዋ ድማ ግድን ኢዩ። ክሳብ ንሰግሮ ኣብ ቅድሜና ጠላዕ ዓቐብ ኢዩ ዘሎ። ስጒምታት ከነፋዂስን ጸኒሕና ምስ ግዜ ምኻድ ከነልዕሎምን እንተዀይና ተረርቲ ዝዀኑ ሃገራውያን ስጒምታት ከየተኣታተና ንክሰልጠና ዘሎ ተኽእሎ ጸቢብ እዩ፡ ኣብ ዝሓለፈት ዓመት ዓበይቲ ውሳኔታት ብቕልጡፍ ኢዮም ክሓልፉ ጸኒሖም። መብዛሕቲኡ ግዜ ድማ ኣመና እናተጠራጠርና ኢና። ንኩሉ ኣብ ቀዳማይ ፈተና ተዓዊትናሉ ማለት ኣይኮነን። ማ ግዜ ምኻድ እናተማሃርና ምስ መጻና፡ ከነስተኻኽሎ ክኢልና ኢና። ብዙሕ ተማሂርና ኣለና። እቲ ዝበለጸ ትርኢት ግና፡ ሕድሕዳዊ ተወፋይነት ኢዩ። ከም ሕብረተሰብ መጠን ብሉጽ ጐንና ከነመስክር ክኢልና ኢና። ጋዜጠኛታት ዓለምና፡ ምስ እዚ ኹሉ፡ ኖርወይ ነዚ ለበዳ ብኸመይ ብሰላም ክትወጽእዎ ክኢልኩም ኣለኹም ብምባል ይሓታትቱ ኢዮም። እቲ መልሲ ኸኣ ሳላኹም እዩ። ኩሉና ብሓባር። ነንሓድሕድና ብምክብባርና ዕድመ ከይፈላለና። ፍልልይ መበቈላትና ከይዓጠጠና። ብሓቂ ተሓቢነ። ብኣኹም ሕብንቲ ኢየ። ከምቲ ኩሉ ሰብ ዝምነዮ፡ ናብ ንቡር እዋን ክምለስ እደሊ ኢየ። ናብ ምስዕዓምን ምትሑቚቛፍን ክምለስ። ኣብ ማሕበራዊ ህይወት እውን ንክተሓዋወስ።  ሜትሮ ከም መዐቀኒት ናብ ንቡር ትምለሰሉ፡ ከም ፈንታቲት ትጠፍኣሉ። ናብ ሰበይ ሰብካ እንብለሉ። ክትመጽእ ኢያ እታ ምዓልቲ። ክትመጽእ ኢያ፡ ተጓዛጒዝና ጥቓ ንጥቓ እንግዶት ስፖርት እንርእየላ። ሲነማ ዲዩ፡ ትያትር ባህላዊ ምርኢት ንምርኣይ ክንኣቱ ኢና ብሓንሳብ። ፌስቲቫላት፡ ምትእኽኻብ፡ በዓላት፡ ተማሃሮ-ሩስ እንዀነሉ፡ ምቅርራብ፡ ምዓልታዊ ህይወትናን ኣውዳኣመትናን ይኹን ክምለሰና ኢዩ። ኩልና ቅድሚ ኣብኡ ምብጻሕና ግና፡ ጌና ዝዛዘም ጉዕዞ ኣሎና። ጒዕዞና ከኣ ናይ ሓባር ኢዩ። ብሓባር ከኣ ኢና ዝያዳ ነድምዕ። ሓቢርና ኸኣ ክንወጽኦ ኢና። ኖርወይ ሕልፊ ኣሎዋ። ብዙሓት ሃገራት ሓያል ጉድኣት ኢዩ ወሪዱወን ዘሎ። ብሕክምናዊ ይኹን ብቊጠባዊ መዳይ ካባና ንላዕሊ ተጐዲአን ይርከባ። ካብዚ ዘሎናዮ ንላዕሊ ክገድድ ምኸኣለ። ቊጠባና ምንቕ ዘይብል ኢዩ። ክታበት ምኽታብ ጀሚርና ኣለና። እናወሰኸ ኸኣ ኢዩ ዝመጽእ ዘሎ። ወርሒ መጋቢት ኣብ ኣጋ ምውጽኡ ዳርጋ 1.2 ሚልዮን ክታበታት ክወሃበና ኢዩ። እዚ ኣቐዲሙ ዝተጠቕሰ ብዝሒ ቁጽሪ ክታበት ወርሒ ምያዝያ ኣብ ኣጋ ምውጽኡ ካብ ዕጽፊ ንላዕሊ ክውስኽ ይኽእል እዩ። ኣብ ወርሒ ግምቦትን ሰነን ድማ ካብኡ ዝበዝሕ ክመጽኣና ኢዩ። እንተ ኣብ ውሽጢ ወይ ኣብ ከባቢ ወቕቲ ክረምቲ ኩሎም ዓበይቲ/እኹላት ዕድል ክታበት ንክረኽቡ ኢዩ ዘሎ ተስፋና። ሰበ ስልጣን ይኹኑ ፖለቲከኛታት ብቐንዱ ሰሚሮም ብሓንሳብ ደው ዝበሉ ኣሎውና፡ ማዕረማዕሪኡ ግና ኣብ መንጐኦም ባህላዊ ፍልልያት ከሎ ክነሱ- ዝተፈላለዩ ስጉምቲታትን ዝተፈላለዩ ፍታሓታን ተጊሆም ክዛታተይሉ ክኢሎም ኢዮም። ሓያላት ዝዀኑ ትካላትን ዋኒናትን ኣሎውና። ኣብ ከበድቲ ፈተነታት ኣትዮም ጸኒሖም ኢዮም። ዝተፈላለዩ ጉጅለተታት ሞያውያንን ወለንታውያንን ድልዱል ብቕዓታትን ሓያል ናይ ምጽዓር ድልየትን ዝውንኑ ኣሎዉና። ተባዓት ዝዀኑ ሽማግለታትን ዘደንቑ መንእሰያትን ኣሎውና። ነንሓድሕዶም ኣሎናካ ኣሎናኩም ዝባሃሃሉ ኢዮም። ብዓቢኡ እውን ንጹጉማን ጉጅለታት ሕብረተሰብና ኣሎናኩም ኢሎሞም ኢዮም። ካብ ኩሉ ቀንዲ ኣገዳሲ ዝዀነ ግና፡ ኣሎኹምና፡ ኩላትና ድማ ኣብ ሕብረትና እዩ እምነትና። ነንሕድሕድና ንተኣማመን ኢና። ዋጋ እምንቶና ዓጸፋታት በረኸት ሃብቲ ነዳዲና ኢዩ። ስሙራት ኢና። ክሳብ ሕጂ ንሓደ ዓመት ምሉእ ሰሚርና ክንምክቶ ጸኒሕና ኢና። ሳላ እጃም ነፍሰ ወከፍኩም -ሓቢርና ንወጽኦ ኣሎና። ጸጽቡቑ ትዝታታት ንጉዕዞ መጻኢና ንማልኣዮ። ክሳብ ሕጂ ብውዕለት ጻዕርና ነንሓድሕድና ንመሰጋገን። ኩነታት ለብዒ ኣብ ወርሒ መጋቢትን ምያዝያን ክንቈጻጸሮ እንተኽኢልና መለክዒ ቁጽሪ ረባሕታ ምልኽኻም ትሕቲ ሓደ ከነውርዶ ንኽእል ኢና። ክሳብ ወርሒ ግምቦት ብዙሓት ክኽተቡ ስለ ዝዀኑ ናብ ንቡር ምዓልታዊ ህይወትና ገጽና ንምሱጓም ንፍልሞ ንኸውን ኢና።  እዛ ተሪፋ ዘላ ዓቐበት ናይ መወዳእታ ክትኮነልና እናተተስፈና ብሓባር ንውጽኣያ። ናብ ነናሓድሕድና እንተሓቛቘፈሉ ንቡር ምዓልታዊ ህይወት ንምምላስና ገጽና ኢና። Hadda oo kale hal sano ka hor ayay ahayd markii xariga laga furay tartankii shiiga ee Holmenkollen ayadoo aysan wax daawadayaal ah joogin. Taas oo ahayd qabanqaabo weyn oo koroonaha dartiis wax looga beddelo tii ugu horreysay. Xilligaas faafitaanka cudurka ayaa ku soo batay Norway. Dad badan baa buuraha Albane ka soo laabtay ayagoo cudurka qaba. 11-kii maarso ayay WHO shaacisay in uu cudurku yahay safmar caalami ah. Jimcahaan 12-ka maarso – hal sano ayaa laga joogaa markii uu fayraska koroonuhu wax walba caadigoodii ka beddelay. Hal mar ayay wax walba is beddeleen. In hab laysa siiyo, in gacanta layska salaamo iyo in bulshadu ay wakhti isla qaadato – intaba waa la xaddiday. Dugsiyadii ayaa la xiray. Xudduudihii ayaa la xiray. Shirkadihii ayaa albaabbada loo laabay. Ruwaayado, qabanqaabooyin, isboortis – wax walba waa istaageen. Jidadka iyo waddooyinkuna cidlo ayay noqdeen. Karantiil, kooxo joogto ah  iyo in gooni looga baxo dadka ayaa noqday ereyo caadi ah. Waxaa ayaguna sidoo kale noqday aalkolada gacmaha iyo gafuur-xir. Hal mitir, laba mitir. Waxaynu dhexda ugu jirnay safmar caalami ah. Wuxuu abuuray welwel, silic iyo geeri. Isla markaana waxaannu aad uga murugeysan nahay dadkii naga dhintay. Dad badan ayay cabsi la soo gudboonaatay.  Ayagoo u cabsanaya dad ka mid ah dadka cudurka u nugul. Ayagoo ka cabsanaya inay laftigoodu ka mid yihiin dadka cudurka u nugul. Ayagoo ka cabsanaya in laga dhinto. Waxay ka welweleen in ay waayaan shaqada iyo dakhliga. Xaalad aan la hubin ayaa jirtay, waayo lama ogeyn xilliga noloshii caadiga ahayd soo laaban doonto. Dad badan ayaa cidlooday. Qorshayaashii ayaa hakad la geliyay. Dad baa riyadoodii seegay. Maynaan ogayn in ay xaaladdan adagi – weli sannad kadib - sidan u taagnaan doonto. In ay sidaas ba i noo roonayd baa laga yaabaa. Waxay qaadatay wakhti ka dheer intii aan filaynay. Haddana waxaa laga wada daalay. Safmar caalami ah. Xaddidaad. In aan xoogaa kale sii adkaysanno. Laakiin taas waa ku khasbannahay. Kala qaadista cudurku mar kale ayay sii badanaysaa. Nooca fayraska ingiriiska ka yimid ayaa hadda soo badanaya. Sidaas darteed weli lagama dhammaan in tillaabooyin adag la soo rogo. Degmooyinka qaar bay hadda ka jiraan tillaabooyin aad u adag. Degmooyin kalena hadda ayuu ka dillaacay cudurku – oo waa inay tillaabooyin dadka ku soo rogaan. Waxa naga horreeya dallacaad loo baahan yahay in aan ka gudubno. Waxay u badan tahay in tillaabooyin kuwaan ka sii adag dalka lagu soo rogi doono, ka hor intaan la fududayn oo aan marka danbana tillaabooyinka la qaadin. Go’aammo waaweyn ayaa si degdeg ah loo qaatay sannadkii u danbeeyay. Inta badan ayadoo ay hubid la’aan badan jirto. Wax kastana isla markiiba sidii la rabay ma noqon. Marba markii ka danbaysay ee aan khibrad yeelannay, ayaan tillaabooyinka wax ka beddelnay. Dhammaanteen wax badan ayaan barannay. Laakiin wixii ugu fiicnaa waxay ahayd sidii ay dadku isu caawiyeen. Bulsho ahaan waxa aynu muujinay wanaageena. Wariyayaasha adduunka oo dhan ayaa is weydiinaya sidee Norway si khasaare yaraan ah uga gudubtay safmarkaan. Jawaabtuna waa adinka. Kulligeen. Tixgelinta aan isu hayno da’ walba oo aan nahay. Iyo wax walba oo aan nahay. Waana mid aan ku faanayo. Waxaa tihiin dad aan ku faano. Sida dadka kale oo dhan ayaan aniguba doonayaa in lagu laabto maalmihii caadiga ahaa. Ee hab laysa siin jiray. Iyo wada bulshaynti. In loo laabto noloshii mitirku ahaa halbeeg ee aanu ahayn kala fogaansho u dhaxaysa dadka. Dadka aan jecel nahay. Waanan gaaraynaa middaas. Waxaan tegi doonnaa qabanqaabooyin isboorti oo dadku cariiri u fadhiyaan. Shaleemo, tiyaatar iyo ruwaayado ayaan isu raaci doonnaa. Waxaan rabnaa feestooyin, isu imaatinno, dabbaaldeg, feestada qalinjebinta , isu dhowaasho, noloshii caadiga ahayd iyo xafladihii. Laakiin waddo ayaa naga xigta ka hor intaynaan kulligeen halkaas gaarin. Waanan ka midaysan nahay arrintaan. Wadajirka ayaan ku fiicannahay. Wadajir ayaanan uga gudbaynaa. Norway waa nasiib badan tahay. Dalal aad u badan ayaa naga daran. Aad nooga daran xag caafimaad iyo xag dhaqaale labadaba. Xaaladdu intaan aad ayay uga xumaan kartay. Dhaqaalahannagu aad buu u fiican yahay. Tallaalkiina waa billowday. In kalena waa soo socotaa. Intaysan maarso dhammaan waxaa la filayaa in aan isu geyn helnay ku dhowaad 1,2 milyan goojo oo tallaal ah. Dhammaadka abriilna waxaa laga yaabaa in ay tiradaasi laba-laab ama ka badan noqoto. Bilaha maajo iyo juun na intaas ka sii badan ayaa la keeni doonaa. Rajadu waa in dadka waaweyn oo dhan tallaalka loogu deeqo billowga ama xagaaga dhexdiisa. Mas’uuliyiinta iyo siyaasiyiintu inta badan isku meel ayay arrinta ka taagnaayeen, ayagoo islamarkaana ku dhiiranayay in laga doodo tillaabooyin iyo xalal kala duwan – ayadoo ka madaxbannaan siyaasadihii caadi ahaan lagu kala duwanaa. Waxaan leennahay hey’ado iyo shirkado xooggan. Imtixaan adag ayaa soo maray. Dad xirfadlayaal ah iyo kuwo walanteeri ah oo aqoon miiran ah, diyaarna u ah in ay wax qabtaan oo badan ayaan leennahay. Waayeel dhiirran iyo dhallinyaro aad u wanaagsan ayaan leennahay. Kuwaas oo miduba kan kale taageerayay. Ayagoo weliba taageerayay dadka nugul. Laakiin waxa ugu muhiimsan: Waa adinka. Dhammaantiin. Midkeenba midka kale ayuu taageeraa. Kalsooni ayaanan isku qabnaa. Waa kalsooni wax badan ka qiima badan khasnadda saliidda. Waanan isku duubannahay. Hal sano ayaan hadda ka soo gudubnay annagoo isku duuban. Mid kasta oo idinka mid ah gacan buu ka geystay sidii aan uga gudbi lahayn – annagoo isku duuban. Dhacdadaan aan ka qaadanno waxyaalihii ugu fiicnaa ee aan ka barannay. Midkeenba midka kale ha uga mahadceliyo dadaalka uu ilaa hadda muujiyay. Kala qaadista cudurka ma xakamayn karnaa maarso iyo abriil? R-da 1 ma ka hoos marin karnaa? Bisha maajo dad badan ayaa tallaalnaan doona oo waxaan qaadi karnaa tillaabadii koowaad ee loogu noqonayay nolol maalmeedkii caadiga ah. Aan is kaashanno oo ka gudubno dallacaadda la rajaynayo in ay noqon doonto tii ugu danbaysay. Waxaan u laabanaynaa maalmihii wakhtiga la wada qaadan jirey.","https://www.regjeringen.no/en/historical-archive/solbergs-government/Ministries/smk/speeches-and-articles/statsministeren/talerogartikler/2021/the-prime-ministers-speech-on-the-coronavirus-situation/id2837294/"
