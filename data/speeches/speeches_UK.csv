"1","PM to chair COBR meeting on the coronavirus outbreak",2020-03-02,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson will today (Monday 2 March) chair a meeting of the government emergency COBR committee on the coronavirus outbreak. The Committee will discuss, finalise and sign off a battle plan containing a detailed set of countermeasures. The Prime Minister will tell the meeting, which will be attended by senior ministers as well as Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Advisor: The number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day - and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country. But we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use - if and when they are needed. COBR has been meeting regularly on this issue since January and will be held as often as needed. As the number of cases in the UK is expected to rise, the action plan will help ensure Government is doing everything it can and can adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Over the past few days, the Prime Minister has been in regular contact with the Chief Medical Officer and Cabinet Ministers at the heart of monitoring and responding to the virus here in the UK, including the Health Secretary and Foreign Secretary. The Prime Minister has also been visiting NHS staff who may be on the frontline, such as those in Kettering General Hospital last week, where he saw their new coronavirus pod, a special sterile cabin outside the hospital, where people can come to be checked. Yesterday, he saw Public Health England’s lab in Colindale, one of a number of labs across the UK where tests are carried out to confirm or rule out coronavirus. He then headed to Royal Free Hospital to meet with staff who are treating patients with the virus. The PM and Health Secretary thank the NHS staff and healthcare professionals for their tremendous work and dedication in responding to this. A war room will also be up and running in the Cabinet Office, bringing together communications experts from across government and the NHS to roll out the public information campaign and respond quickly to cross-cutting issues.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-to-chair-cobr-meeting-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak"

"3","PM announces new funding in fight against spread of coronavirus",2020-03-06,"The global race to find a vaccine for coronavirus will be bolstered by support announced by the Prime Minister today, funded by the UK’s international development budget. The global race to find a vaccine for coronavirus will be bolstered by support announced by the Prime Minister today, funded by the UK’s international development budget. Supported by UK funding, eight possible coronavirus vaccines are currently under development and efforts are being made to get any viable vaccines from sequencing of the virus to clinical testing in under a year - a record timeframe. Governments around the world could then work with pharmaceutical companies to get vaccines into production and use. Today’s additional support will bring the UK’s investment into COVID-19 research to £65 million. UK experts are leading the scientific and medical response to the global coronavirus outbreak and the UK was one of the first countries to establish a laboratory test for the virus. However, no country has yet found a method of diagnosing coronavirus without sending samples to a lab for testing – a process that can take several days. Today the Prime Minister visited Mologic lab in Bedfordshire which is using UK aid funding to develop rapid diagnostic test devices for coronavirus to allow medical professionals or potentially even individuals at home to identify the disease quickly without relying on specialist facilities. This will mean patients can be treated more quickly, reducing the risk of them passing the virus onto others and helping them to recover quickly. The lab is building on extensive experience creating similar tests for other infections. Efforts to develop a diagnostic test form part of the Government’s work to limit the spread of the virus, investing in and informed by scientific research. A rapid diagnostic test can also be used by countries around the world that are not currently able to diagnose the virus at all. Low-income countries without the medical infrastructure to conduct laboratory tests or who do not have access to the necessary reagents are not able to differentiate coronavirus from other common causes of fever such as other bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. The majority of cases in those countries are therefore going unchecked, increasing the risk of the virus spreading both locally and around the world. To ensure access to the technology, the test will therefore be jointly manufactured in the UK and Senegal — the first time a diagnostic has been produced in the continent, supported by UK aid funding. Today’s announcement builds on the plan set out by the Prime Minister earlier this week to tackle coronavirus in the UK. The Government is doing everything possible, based on the advice of world-leading scientific experts, to prepare for all eventualities. This plan has four strands - containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. Today’s funding package, which includes support for the World Health Organization’s Flash Appeal, will also help vulnerable countries prepare for the spread of the disease in other ways. UK-funded infectious disease experts are working in developing countries which have large urban populations and transport links to the UK and to China and other countries experiencing large outbreaks. Experts will support countries to prepare for and respond to suspected cases, for example by creating effective isolation zones. International efforts are being coordinated by a new UK Government Coronavirus International Taskforce, bringing together expertise from the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Coronavirus is the biggest threat in countries whose healthcare systems are unable to cope with large outbreaks. Ensuring those countries have mechanisms in place will prevent a surge of cases which would also present risks to us at home. Today’s announcement brings the UK’s total support to fight the virus internationally to £91 million. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: Keeping the British people safe is my number one priority, and that’s why I’ve set out our four-part plan to contain, delay, mitigate and research coronavirus. We are ensuring the country is prepared for the current outbreak, guided by the science at every stage. But we also need to invest now in researching the vaccines that could help prevent future outbreaks. I’m very proud that UK experts – backed by government funding – are on the front line of global efforts to do just that. International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: The UK is well-prepared to respond to potential cases of coronavirus at home, but a global response is needed to effectively combat the disease. We are investing UK aid and using the best of British expertise and science to find new ways to vaccinate against, treat and diagnose the virus, and to support global efforts to prevent further outbreaks around the world. Every action that we take to prevent the virus spreading makes the UK safer. Government Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said: Rapid testing is going to be key to managing this outbreak, but ultimately vaccines are going to provide the long-term protection we need. The UK has some of the world’s leading scientists and this money will help in our fight to tackle this new disease. Director-General of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: The United Kingdom’s support for the global response to the new coronavirus outbreak will protect the health of people in many parts of the world, from assisting countries with fragile health systems to fuelling the fight to find a vaccine. At this critical time in the battle against COVID-19, the WHO is grateful for the UK’s solidarity and commitment to keeping people safe at home and around the world. It comes ahead of the UK hosting the “Global Vaccine Summit 2020” in June, demonstrating the UK’s leadership in global health security.

"4","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 March 2020",2020-03-09,"This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick. There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families. Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate. We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase. We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage. Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops. As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about. But before that I want to stress the following things: First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable. And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive. There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-9-march-2020"
"5","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 March 2020",2020-03-12,"Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming. I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time. But it is now a global pandemic. And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous. And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment. But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan. Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads. Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track. We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread. But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect. At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time. We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice. There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months. The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can. I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other. And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can. So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands. And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020"

The press conferences form part of the government’s commitment to clarity and transparency in order to ensure British people are fully informed about the steps they can take to protect themselves and others. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The Prime Minister and this Government are committed to keeping the public informed every step of the way about what we’re doing to fight the spread of coronavirus, when we’re doing it and why we’re doing it. At all times we will be led by the science to bring forward the right responses at the right time to this global pandemic. On Monday morning the Prime Minister will speak to British manufacturers including Unipart Group to ask them to support production of essential medical equipment for the NHS. He will stress the vital role of Britain’s manufacturers in preparing the country for a significant spread of coronavirus and call on them to step up and support the nationwide effort to fight the virus. A Downing Street spokesperson said: Preparing for the spread of the coronavirus outbreak is a national priority and we’re calling on the manufacturing industry and all those with relevant expertise who might be able to help to come together to help the country tackle this national crisis. We need to step up production of vital equipment such as ventilators so that we can all help the most vulnerable, and we need businesses to come to us and help in this national effort. On Monday afternoon the Prime Minister will also chair another meeting of the COBR emergency committee to coordinate the government’s ongoing response to coronavirus. The meeting is expected to include discussion on current modelling of the outbreak and next steps on plans around shielding elderly and vulnerable people, household isolation and mass gatherings. Following his calls over the last few days with world leaders including President Trump, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Abe, Prime Minister Conte and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman the Prime Minister will continue his engagement with international partners to ensure a coordinated global response to the outbreak. Tomorrow all G7 leaders will participate in a call  to discuss international efforts. The Prime Minister will encourage fellow leaders to support the World Health Organization response, provide funding and expertise for research that can ensure rapid progress to develop a vaccine, and drive forward support to mitigate the economic impacts of the crisis. In the past few weeks the UK has shown leadership by providing up to £150 million to the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to support the economies of developing countries affected by the virus, £50 million for the Centre for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations which is leading the global research and development of a vaccine, £25 million for further research into the virus including to develop a rapid test, and £10 million for the WHO’s flash appeal for the outbreak.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-to-lead-cross-government-drive-to-defeat-coronavirus"
"11","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 March 2020",2020-03-16,"Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK. As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice. Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days. That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies. And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now. So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111. Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions. And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure? The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives. And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities. And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable. So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks. And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary. And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease. And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others. And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants. Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well. And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from. And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope. Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role. We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease. To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it. I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020"

"13","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 March 2020",2020-03-18,"Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor. I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that. I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough. Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands. And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day. A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others. We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge. And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice. And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off.  And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic. And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable. And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review. So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools. So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils. The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups. So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children. This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning. So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. 
And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career. Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work. And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday. I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures. I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all. By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science. We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease. But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead. And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-18-march-2020"
"14","PM Mother's Day words: 22 March 2020",2020-03-22,"Today is Mother’s Day. It is a day when we celebrate the sacrifice and the effort of those who gave us life, and across the country I know that millions of people will have been preparing to do something special; not just a card, not just flowers. I know that everyone’s strongest instinct is to go and see their mothers in person, to have a meal together, to show them how much you love them. But I am afraid that this Mothering Sunday the single best present that we can give – we who owe our mothers so much – is to spare them the risk of catching a very dangerous disease. The sad news is that means staying away. This time the best thing is to ring her, video call her, Skype her, but to avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity. And why? Because if your mother is elderly or vulnerable, then I am afraid all the statistics show that she is much more likely to die from coronavirus, or Covid-19. We cannot disguise or sugar coat the threat. The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy. The Italians have a superb health care system. And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand. The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread – then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed. That is why this country has taken the steps that it has, in imposing restrictions never seen before either in peace or war. We have closed the schools, the pubs, the bars, the restaurants, the gyms, and we are asking people to stay and work at home if they possibly can. In order to help businesses and workers through the crisis, we have come up with unprecedented packages of support. All of this is putting our country, and our society, under enormous strain. But already this crisis is also bringing out the best in us all – in the army of volunteers that has sprung up to help the vulnerable, in the millions of acts of kindness; in the work of all the people who are continuing to provide essential services, from transport workers to supermarket staff to health and social care workers. Yes, this disease is forcing us apart – at least physically. But this epidemic is also the crucible in which we are already forging new bonds of togetherness and altruism and sharing. This country will be changed by coronavirus, but there is every reason to think we will come through it stronger and better than ever before. And the more effectively we follow the medical advice, the faster we will bounce back to health – medically and economically. So this Mothering Sunday let’s all do everything we can to show our respect and love to those who gave us life – and minimise the risk to their own lives. Bit by bit, day by day, we are all helping to delay the spread of the disease, and to give our amazing NHS staff the time to prepare for the peak. So let’s follow the advice, stay home this Mothering Sunday. Send her your love by phone or skype. Let’s stay at home, protect our NHS, and together we will save literally thousands of lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-mothers-day-words-22-march-2020"
"15","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 March 2020",2020-03-22,"Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making. I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today. Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did. Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this. Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be. And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives. Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable. I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail. But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease. We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed. And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker. And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors. Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity. You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice. And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial. And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary. Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease. The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together. Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-22-march-2020"
"16","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 March 2020",2020-03-23,"Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction -  you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times. The people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 25 March 2020. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for today’s daily briefing on coronavirus. I would like to update you all on the government’s plan to defeat the virus and on the latest developments. I am joined once again by our Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance. From the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists. To defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time. What everyone needs to recognise is that our NHS – like any world-class health service – has only limited numbers of doctors, nurses and specialist equipment. So, the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope. And so it is vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time. That is why we have given the clear instruction that people must stay at home – unless they have one of the reasons we have set out. And, with your help we will slow the spread of the disease. I want to thank everyone who has been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday. And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the front line of the fight against coronavirus. And of course all our public services. Our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers, And everyone who is keeping this country going. But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS. When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days. But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call. They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients. They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home. And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus. That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry. And so, to all of you, and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service. I say thank you on behalf of the entire country. Now I want to take some questions but finally I want to remind everyone of our core policy: Stay at home Protect the NHS And save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-25-march-2020"
"18","PM video message on coronavirus: 27 March 2020",2020-03-27,"Hi folks. I want to bring you up to speed on something that’s happening today which is that I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say – a temperature and a persistent cough. And, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive. So I am working from home. I’m self-isolating. And that’s entirely the right thing to do. But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus. And I want to thank everybody who’s involved, I want to thank, above all, our amazing NHS staff. It was very moving last night to join in that national clap for the NHS. But it’s not just the NHS, it’s our police, our social care workers, teachers, everybody who works in schools, DWP staff. An amazing national effort by the public services. But also by every member of the British public who’s volunteering, an incredible response – 600,000 people have volunteered to take part in a great national effort to protect people from the consequences of coronavirus – I want to thank you. I want to thank everybody who’s working to keep our country going through this epidemic. And we will get through it. And the way we’re going to get through it is, of course, by applying the measures that you’ll have heard so much about. And the more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country will come through this epidemic and the faster we’ll bounce back. So thank you to everybody who’s doing what I’m doing, working from home, to stop the spread of the virus from household to household. That’s the way we’re going to win, we’re going to beat it, and we’re going to beat it together. Stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-video-message-on-coronavirus-27-march-2020"

Coronavirus press conference 30 April 2020. Good afternoon, welcome everyone again to this Number Ten press conference where I am joined by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance our Chief Scientific Advisor And I am sorry not to have been part of this trio for so long I want to thank everybody who has been doing such a good job in my absence and I want to thank the NHS for so much Including getting me back here and I might add for a much happier hospital visit yesterday In a few minutes I am going to hand over to Patrick to update you on the epidemic But first I am going to set out today’s latest data 901,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 81,611 tests yesterday 171,253 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,032 cases since yesterday 15,043 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, compared to 15,359 people yesterday And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 26,711 have now died. That’s an increase of 674 fatalities since yesterday across all settings. This figure of course includes deaths not just in hospitals. Across this country, therefore, families every day are continuing to lose loved ones before their time We grieve for them and with them But as we grieve we are strengthened in our resolve to defeat this virus To get this whole country back to health, back on its feet And we are determined urgently and in particular to overcome those challenges that in the last few weeks have been so knotty and so infuriating I’m not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes Or the frustrations that we have experienced in expanding the numbers of tests But what I can tell you is that everyone responsible for tackling these problems whether in Government or the NHS, or Public Health England, local authorities We are throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day To get it right – and we will get it right and we are making huge progress And I will not underrate the work and the achievement of those who are dealing with global shortages, in a global pandemic They are rising to a challenge we have never seen in our lifetimes And the same can be said of the entire people of this country
Staying in enforced confinement Not seeing family, not seeing friends or grandchildren Worrying about their jobs and the future And so my message to everyone again today is your effort and your sacrifice is working and has been proved to work Today the number of Covid hospital admissions is falling The number of patients in ICU is falling We have so far succeeded in the first and most important task we set ourselves as a nation To avoid the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world Because at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed No patient went without a ventilator No patient was deprived of intensive care We have five of the seven projected Nightingale wards And it is thanks to that massive collective effort to shield the NHS that we avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic where the reasonable worst case scenario was 500,000 deaths And so I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope And we have so many reasons to be hopeful for the long term The UK is leading international efforts to find a vaccine Today Oxford university has announced a partnership with Astrazeneca to develop what they believe could soon be a means of inoculating ourselves against this disease But until this day comes – and I am afraid we cannot say exactly when it may be We will have to beat this disease by our growing resolve and ingenuity So I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week To explain how we can get our economy moving, one, How we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third
how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy. A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK But there will be five key tests that we must satisfy before we can put that plan into action We must be sure that we can continue to protect the NHS and its ability to cope We must see a sustained fall in deaths We must be sure that the infection rate is falling We must overcome the operational and logistical challenges on testing and PPE Fifth, and this is the most important, we must all make sure that the measures we take do not risk a second spike that would overwhelm the NHS We have come through the peak Or rather we’ve come under what could have been a vast peak as though we’ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one And before I hand over to Patrick I am going to ask for a short explanatory clip about the one And before we come to that clip, let me just emphasise that keeping the R down is going to be absolutely vital to our recovery, keeping the reproduction rate of the disease down, and we can only do it by our collective discipline and working together I know we can do it, because we did it, we’ve shown we can do it, in phase one of this disease This country came together in a way few of us have seen in our lifetimes To protect the NHS and to save lives and that’s why I am absolutely convinced we can do it in phase two as well Can we play the video now.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-april-2020"
"21","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 May 2020",2020-05-10,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation on coronavirus. It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost. It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response. I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels. Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.
We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.
It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already. The patience and common sense you have shown. The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can. The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers. The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease. Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more. The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase. I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.
More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-10-may-2020"
"22","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 May 2020",2020-05-11,"Coronavirus press conference 11 May 2020 Good evening and thank you for joining us for this Downing Street press conference. First of all, I want to update you on the latest data in our fight against coronavirus. I can report through the Government’s ongoing testing and monitoring programme that, as of today: Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of a number of important things I said in my address to the nation last night. First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System. The COVID Alert Level has five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The level will be primarily determined by the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. In turn, that COVID Alert Level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures. Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4 – meaning a Covid19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in steps. And we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS. After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so. Step 1 - from this week: Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow: And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it safe, we aim to allow: More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship. Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this. So, given we have taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures today, and therefore our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging. We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives. Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take as we modify measures. People should Stay Alert, by: Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-11-may-2020"
"23","Prime Minister's article in the Mail on Sunday: 17 May 2020",2020-05-17,"If 2020 has taught us anything, it is truly that the worst of times bring out the best in humanity. Every day brings heart-breaking news as more lives are lost before their time to this vicious coronavirus. Every victim leaves behind family, friends and loved ones who mourn their loss. They remain constantly in my thoughts; each death a spur to redouble our efforts to defeat this virus. We can only defeat it by acting together. In recent weeks we have seen phenomenal bravery, compassion and selflessness as people go above and beyond to protect the lives of others. The staff in our care homes and NHS doing all they can to bring the sick back to health. Teachers helping critical workers go to work by looking after their children, while still teaching those at home. Police and prison officers keeping order on our streets and in our prisons. Those producing, processing, distributing and selling food. Engineers keeping the lights on and our broadband connected. Our armed forces rising to every logistical challenge with awesome professionalism. Civil servants working round the clock to implement every policy decision – all these people are putting others first. They are the best of us, punctuating each day with a million acts of love and kindness. And their efforts have not been in vain for a simple reason – because the British people as a whole have risen so magnificently to the challenge we set: to stay at home. I don’t underestimate how difficult it has been for everyone to be cut off from friends and parents, children and grandchildren, brothers and sisters. Unable to visit places of worship or even just spend time with others. We thrive off social contact and having those we love around us – it’s human nature. Yet those vital human connections have been cruelly denied to all of us by this insidious disease. These enormous sacrifices have paid off. We have seen the number of positive cases plateau and fall, even as testing capacity has increased tenfold. The number of people admitted to hospital with Covid has steadily fallen. Despite predictions that critical care capacity would struggle to cope, the NHS was emphatically not overwhelmed. I made clear from the outset that we can only make changes to the lockdown when it is safe to do so, guided by science. We set five tests, of which three have been met and progress is being made on the remaining two. We are setting up a system of COVID-19 Alert levels, which will be overseen by a new UK Joint Biosecurity Centre designed to assess the spread of the virus and inform decisions over how we lift the lockdown. It is the British public’s fortitude, their perseverance, their good common sense and their desire to return to the freedoms they hold dear that has allowed us to inch forwards. We have announced new rules on what people can and cannot do in England. You can now spend as much time as you like outdoors, for example sitting and enjoying the fresh air, picnicking, or sunbathing. You can meet one other person from a different household outdoors, provided you maintain social distancing. You can exercise outdoors as often as you wish and play sport. Even with these changes, it’s vital that people stay alert, keep their distance from others and carry on washing their hands regularly. These changes are possible because the evidence shows that the risk of transmission is significantly lower outdoors. Being able to see a friend or family member at a safe distance, in a park or at the end of the road, provides significant benefits to our physical and mental wellbeing - but crucially, it does not risk reversing the gains we have so far won in the fight against the virus. I am confident that the balance of risk, taking everything into account, means we can safely make this change. Now that we have driven the rate of infection down, and there are fewer infections, some people can also start returning to work. We have held extensive talks with employers, trade unions and the devolved administrations about how to make workplaces safe. The COVID-19 Secure guidelines we developed together mean we can encourage people who can’t work from home to go to their place of work in a safe way. The message is: work from home if you can but travel to work if you can’t. And avoid public transport if you can, but use it if you can’t. No earlier than June, we hope to move to step two, opening schools to more children and re-opening some shops. And no earlier than July, we can move to step three, opening parts of the leisure and hospitality sectors. Over time we can gradually get closer to a kind of normality - but only if the evidence shows these adjustments are compatible with our five tests. And if at any stage we need to tighten the restrictions, we will not hesitate to act. Nothing is more important than saving lives. I understand that people will feel frustrated with some of the new rules. We are trying to do something that has never had to be done before - moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work. I recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home - but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people. If we all stick at it, then we’ll be able, gradually, to get rid of the complexities and the restrictions and make it easier and simpler for families to meet again. But we must move slowly, and at the right time. I want to thank you personally for sticking with us and - most of all - for being so patient. And I want to reassure you that there is a route out of this. In the darkness of March, I said that with hard work, we could turn the tide within three months. We have now passed through the peak. I said that, if we could get an antibody test showing whether you have had the disease, it would be a huge step forward. This week Public Health England have approved an antibody test which is 100% accurate. I said we would throw everything we could at finding a vaccine. There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition. But we are leading the global effort. Some of the most promising research into vaccines is happening right here in the UK - and this weekend we are announcing a £93 million investment to open the new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre a full 12 months ahead of schedule. We are also supporting research into drug treatments for the virus which can bring as many people who have caught the virus back to full health as possible. Despite these efforts, we have to acknowledge we may need to live with this virus for some time to come. We need to find new ways to control the virus. We will do that through testing and tracing - testing individuals who have symptoms to see if they have the virus and tracing contacts who may have been infected. The NHS app and an army of contact tracers will help us alert anyone who may have caught the virus. By asking them to self isolate, we will help them protect their friends, family and loved ones, while stopping the spread of the virus in the wider community. By screening arrivals at ports and airports and introducing quarantine measures, we will be able to keep the number of infections at low levels, and we can give everyone else more freedom to lead their lives as normally as possible. We have achieved a lot together so far. Let’s not throw it all away now. In return for the small freedoms we are now allowing ourselves, we must stay alert. We must do so in the knowledge that our self-discipline will, eventually, lead to the return of our much-missed normality. I know this will not be easy - the first baby steps never are. But I hope that, when we look back, the changes we have made this week will be seen as an important moment on the road to our nation’s recovery.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-mail-on-sunday-17-may-2020"
"24","New measures announced ahead of Hidden Harms Summit",2020-05-21,"The government will spearhead a new codeword scheme for domestic abuse victims, which will allow people in urgent or immediate danger to get help from shop workers by using a specific phrase that staff will be trained to identify. The new scheme, which has been championed by the Victims’ Commissioner, Domestic Abuse Commissioner and crisis support charities such as SafeLives and Hestia, will be discussed at the Hidden Harms Summit today (Thursday 21 May). Representatives from government, law enforcement, victims’ charities, front line practitioners and the private sector will drive forward action to support victims of crimes such as domestic abuse, sexual violence, child sexual abuse and modern slavery. The virtual summit, hosted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is in response to the unique challenges victims have faced during the coronavirus pandemic and to ensure they continue to get support. Attendees include representatives from the National Crime Agency, National Police Chiefs’ Council, the children’s, domestic abuse, anti-slavery and victims’ commissioners and leaders from domestic abuse and children’s charities, including the NSPCC, Refuge and Women’s Aid. Ahead of the summit the government has announced it is working with business groups, such as the National Pharmacy Association and British Retail Consortium, and domestic abuse charities, on the implementation of a codeword scheme to support domestic abuse victims. In addition to this, funding will support law enforcement to target perpetrators sexually exploiting children and help those affected by abuse rebuild their lives. Around £10 million will boost the National Crime Agency’s ability to tackle paedophiles operating on the dark web and a further £3.36 million has been allocated to projects to understand the threat posed by the most serious criminals. This follows the unprecedented £76 million extra funding for vulnerable people from the government’s £750 million package of support for charities. This included £34.1 million to safeguard vulnerable children, £28 million to help survivors of domestic abuse, £10 million to support victims of sexual violence and £1.73 million for modern slavery support services. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: I am acutely aware that for some people home is not a safe space, and that coronavirus has brought with it additional dangers. Just as I am committed to tackling the virus, we have to support the most vulnerable and keep them safe from harm and exploitation. That is why it is vital that we come together and bring all our collective expertise to ensure we are doing everything we can to support those at risk, and to help them rebuild their lives. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: While the necessary social distancing guidelines are keeping the majority of us safe, they are amplifying danger for others. Protecting vulnerable people from the most sickening crimes such as child sexual abuse and domestic abuse has been my priority since the very start of this crisis. This summit will enable us, along with experts from the public and private sectors, to develop an action plan to protect victims as we seek to rebuild society. Justice Secretary & Lord Chancellor, Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP, said: We have taken every measure possible to protect the most vulnerable throughout this pandemic. This includes an unprecedented £750 million boost for front line charities and making sure victims can still access the support they desperately rely on remotely. Our message is clear that despite these difficult times no one should suffer in silence. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: Now more than ever, we must make sure the most vulnerable children and families in our society are protected from any hidden harms they may face, including abuse, exploitation or neglect. We know that the nature of such harms have changed, and this summit is an opportunity for us to reaffirm our wholehearted commitment to working together to keep children safe. The summit will also provide an opportunity to show victims that support is available, empower them to reach out for help and give a forum for key stakeholders to come up with further solutions to tackle these harms. It will also discuss the proactive and innovative tactics being piloted by police forces to tackle domestic abuse, such as Cumbria, South Wales and Sussex, which include methods for better identifying those posing the highest risk of offending and multi-agency approaches to prevent re-offending. As well as the opening session chaired by the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Education Secretary will also lead meetings on law enforcement, victim support and safeguarding vulnerable people in the community. Further measures announced ahead of the summit include: National Crime Agency Director General Lynne Owens said: Tackling child sexual abuse must be a priority for all of us, this includes the tech industry. The NCA and UK policing relentlessly fight the online child sexual abuse threat, arresting more than 650 child sex offenders and safeguarding around 750 children each month. The additional funding for this financial year will enable the NCA to de-anonymise and arrest more child sex offenders operating on the dark web and safeguard more children. SafeLives Chief Executive Suzanne Jacob, CEO, said: In normal times domestic abuse victims and survivors talk about walking on eggshells. During this period of lockdown they have talked about walking on glass. We warmly welcome the chance to speak about this to the Prime Minister and Ministers with responsibilities for mental health, law enforcement and child safeguarding, and are delighted that a SafeLives Pioneer – an expert by experience – can also have her voice and views heard directly by those who shape UK policy. Susie Hargreaves OBE, Chief Executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said: Now is the time, more than ever, to work together to make sure children are not exposed to risk or harm online. Over the last month, 8.8 million attempts have been made in the UK alone, across three internet service providers, to access known child sexual abuse imagery. On top of this, there has been an 89% reduction in the number of webpages being removed from the IWF’s URL list, meaning this content is remaining live for longer. In the past week, our analysts have taken action on the first self-generated indecent image of a child created over the lockdown period. We simply have to act now to avoid things worsening further, and the IWF will be working alongside the Government, technology companies, parents, and other partners to make sure our children are kept out of harm and can use the internet safely. Lyndsey Dearlove, Head of UK SAYS NO MORE at Hestia, said: Since launching Safe Spaces nationwide, Hestia’s UK SAYS NO MORE campaign has seen an immediate response from pharmacies across the UK to open their consultation rooms to allow victims of domestic abuse to seek specialist support. Key workers in pharmacies hold a unique position within the community and through their rapid response Safe Spaces are now operating in a quarter of all pharmacies in the UK. We welcome the government’s support to enhance measures for victims of domestic abuse that can provide the opportunity for victims to discreetly seek specialist support as part of someone’s daily routine. Employers Initiative on Domestic Abuse Chair Elizabeth Filkin said: Today’s virtual Hidden Harms Summit is an important opportunity for businesses to work with domestic abuse charities and other stakeholders at an unprecedented time for those affected by domestic abuse. The Employers’ Initiative on Domestic Abuse has long championed the role of businesses in helping to identify and tackle domestic abuse, so we welcome the prospect of the codeword scheme. We all have a role to play in rooting out domestic abuse from our society, a fact underscored by the significant rise in reports of abuse during the lockdown. As public health restrictions begin to be relaxed, the role of businesses and colleagues in helping to support those at risk of abuse will be all the more important. That’s why today’s summit is a crucial opportunity to discuss and share ideas on the challenges which lie ahead.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-announced-ahead-of-hidden-harms-summit"
"25","PM confirms schools, colleges and nurseries on track to begin phased reopening",2020-05-24,"Schools, colleges and nurseries across England remain on track to open to more children from 1 June, the Prime Minister confirmed today (24 May 2020). Primary schools will welcome back children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, while nurseries and other early years providers will begin welcoming back children of all ages. Secondary schools, sixth forms and colleges will also provide face-to-face contact for Year 10, Year 12 and equivalent 16-19 further education students to help them prepare for exams next year. It is expected this will begin from 15 June, with around a quarter of these secondary students in at any point. The Prime Minister today praised teachers, childcare workers and support staff for the brilliant work they have been doing throughout the pandemic. This includes providing remote education for those not in school, as well as continuing to provide face-to-face education for the children of priority groups, including vulnerable children and children of critical workers. He also acknowledged that some schools may not be able to reopen immediately, and committed the government to continuing to work with the sector to ensure any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open as soon as possible. In line with our roadmap setting out how the UK will adjust its response to the virus, our approach to schools remains a cautious, phased one. It is also broadly in line with other European countries. We continue to consider all the evidence, as we said we would, and will continue to work with schools, teachers and unions over the coming week before making a final decision. It also remains the case that schools will only reopen to more children if the government’s five tests are met by Thursday 28 May. In the coming days, the Prime Minister will set out the government’s progress in meeting these five tests, which are: Today’s announcement comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Clear, detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents. While we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, our guidance sets out a range of measures to protect children and staff. This includes: All children and staff, and their families, will also have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive a test and trace approach can be taken. Children will also be encouraged not to travel on public transport where possible, in line with the advice to the wider population. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: This has been a difficult time for the entire country. Education and childcare staff have stepped up to the challenge, making sure children and young people have continued to be supported throughout the past ten weeks. Our priority is the education and welfare of all children and young people across the country. That is why we want to start a phased wider opening of nurseries, school and colleges is informed by the best possible scientific and medical advice. We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-confirms-schools-colleges-and-nurseries-on-track-to-begin-phased-reopening"
"26","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 24 May 2020",2020-05-24,"Coronavirus press conference 24 May 2020 Good afternoon. I want to begin by answering the big question that people have been asking in the last 48 hours. And that is – is this Government asking you - the people, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in government do something else? Have we been asking you to make sacrifices, to obey social distancing, to stay at home while some people have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives? And it is because I take this matter so seriously and frankly it is so serious that I can tell you today I have had extensive face to face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus. And when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. And though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false. I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives. And I stress this fundamental aim, because it is thanks to this country’s collective resolve in achieving that aim that we continue to make progress. So let me give you today’s figures: And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,793 have now died. That’s an increase of 118 fatalities since yesterday. And each of those fatalities represents a family in mourning, the grief of friends and relatives. And as we mourn them we resolve again to beat this virus and get our country back on its feet. We can and we will. Two weeks ago I set out the Government’s roadmap to begin easing the measures we put in place to control the spread of coronavirus. I said that we would do so in a safe and controlled way, based on our assessment of progress against the five tests we set for adjusting the lockdown. We’re going to set out that assessment in detail in the coming days, but today I can confirm that I do believe we will be in a position to move to step 2 of our plan. As part of Step 2, we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools. Because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future and for social justice And so in line with the approach being taken by other countries, we want to start getting our children back in the classroom in a way that is manageable and as safe as possible. So we said this would begin with early years settings and reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in primary schools. Today I can announce that it is our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June 1st, a week on Monday. We then intend, from June 15th, for secondary schools to provide some contact for Year 10 and Year 12 students to help them prepare for exams next year, with up to a quarter of these students in at any point. By opening schools to more pupils in this limited way, we are taking a deliberately cautious approach. And this comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I want to thank all the Education and childcare staff who have stepped up to the challenge and kept schools open throughout this crisis. The Department for Education will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plans. And the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will of course continue to consider all the evidence (as we said we would do), and will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week. However, I think it is important for us to be clear about the Government’s intentions now, so that teachers and parents can plan in earnest for schools to reopen a week on Monday. Now I acknowledge that a 1 June opening may not be possible for all schools, but the Government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible. Detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents. While of course we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, especially when teaching young children, our guidance sets out a range of protective measures to keep children and staff safe. This includes: All children and staff, and their families, will have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures. We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible. We will set out what moving to step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts, over the course of the next week. And let me stress once again: we are making good progress. But that progress is conditional, provisional. We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease. We must keep that R down below 1. And that means we must remember the basics. Wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the faster if we stay alert, control the virus and save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-24-may-2020"
"27","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 May 2020",2020-05-25,"Coronavirus press conference 25 May 2020 Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press Conference Before I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data 3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday; 261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday; 8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week; And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals. And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them. Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19 It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus. And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one. So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure. At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart. I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today. We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday. But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2. And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect. Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers. This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready. Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready. So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing. We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus. Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other  non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure. Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take. While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required. I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises. The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open. These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country. And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together. We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-25-may-2020"
"28","Prime Minister sets out timeline for retail to reopen in June",2020-05-25,"Thousands of high street shops, department stores and shopping centres across England are set to reopen next month once they are COVID-19 secure and can show customers will be kept safe, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed today. The Prime Minister has set out: Shops like supermarkets and pharmacies have been trading responsibly throughout the pandemic. Building on this and in line with the government’s roadmap, reopening non-essential retail is the next step towards restoring people’s livelihoods, restarting the UK’s economy, and ensuring vital public services like the NHS continue to be funded. Businesses will only be able to open from these dates once they have completed a risk assessment, in consultation with trade union representatives or workers, and are confident they are managing the risks. They must have taken the necessary steps to become COVID-19 secure in line with the current Health and Safety legislation. The government is taking action to help businesses re-open and protect their staff and customers, including: The updated guidance takes into account the best practice demonstrated by the many retailers which have been allowed to remain open and have applied social distancing measures in store. Measures that shops should consider include: The vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, but tough powers are in place to enforce action if they don’t, including fines and jail sentences of up to 2 years. As per the roadmap, hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, and the hospitality sector, remain closed, because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher where long periods of person to person contact is required. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: The high street sits at the heart of every community in the country. Enabling these businesses to open will be a critical step on the road to rebuilding our economy, and will support millions of jobs across the UK. The guidance we have set out today provides a vital framework to get shops open in a way that is safe for everyone. It explains how retail workers who are not currently working can go back to work as safely as possible and feel confident in their workplace. And it reassures customers that shops are properly assessing the risks and putting in place measures to protect them. Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director General, said: As our high streets slowly reawaken, this new guidance is important for businesses on the ground. Our shops are doing all they can to keep the public and their staff safe, and we’ve seen many retailers leading from the front with innovative solutions to do just that. As more and more businesses turn their attention to reopening, this guidance will help them plan to do so safely and securely. Andrew Goodacre, CEO, British Independent Retailers Association, said: Bira is pleased with the guidance being given to retail outlets. It provides a broad framework for the basic measures and still allows the retailer to be flexible according to the size, layout and location of the shop. This guidance will ensure that independent retailers provide safe environments for employees and customers. read the government guidance on the regulations governing which businesses can, and cannot, remain open businesses that identify as homeware have been permitted to remain open by the regulations. The government is proposing to allow all other retail to open from 15 June provided, as with other retailers, they are COVID-secure. The changes from 15 June would include furniture shops where they have not fallen within another class of business already permitted to open under the regulations","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-timeline-for-retail-to-reopen-in-june"
"29","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 May 2020",2020-05-28,"This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 28 May 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 28 May 2020. Good evening, Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data: As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide. It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people. At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far. I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April. On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April. This significant progress means we are meeting the first test. Can I have the next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May. Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met. And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress. Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day. We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons. We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion. Can I have the next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds. This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious. It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus. So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit. On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools. A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy. We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier. And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure. Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other. So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart. At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment. But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with. Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus. And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so. I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope. We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon. I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way. We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus. We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread. And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside. I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them. Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy. I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting. It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time. But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have. By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today. These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped. There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more. Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life. But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional. They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe. And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front. And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks. And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week. And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part. Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020"
"30","PM: Six people can meet outside under new measures to ease lockdown",2020-05-28,"Read the PM’s press conference statement here. Groups of up to six people will be able to meet outdoors in England from Monday 1 June, including in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, provided strict social distancing guidelines are followed. The Prime Minister announced the change as he set out a carefully-designed package to ease the burdens of lockdown in a way that is expected to keep the R rate down. Thanks to the public’s continued patience and hard work in helping to protect the NHS and contain the virus, the Prime Minister confirmed that the government’s five tests are being met. This means we can now move forward to the next phase of adjusting the lockdown. In line with the Prime Minister’s announcements earlier this week, a series of measures will be put in place in England from Monday 1 June in three core areas – schools, retail, and social contact. Primary schools will welcome back children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 on 1 June, and nurseries and other early years settings will be reopened. On 15 June, secondary schools, sixth forms and colleges will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for Year 10 and 12 and the equivalent groups in further education. This will help students prepare for exams next year, and we expect there to be around a quarter of these secondary students in at any point. The Prime Minister has also acknowledged that some schools may not be able to reopen immediately, and has committed the government to continuing to work with the sector to ensure any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open as soon as possible. Thousands of high street shops, department stores and shopping centres will also begin to reopen in June as we restart the economy. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be able to reopen from 1 June, provided they meet COVID-19 secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. We intend to open all other non-essential retail from 15 June, as long as the government’s five tests are still being met and COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed. Recognising the impact that lockdown is having on family and friends who have been unable to see each other, the Prime Minister announced today that from 1 June up to six people from different households will be allowed to meet outside, including in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. The evidence shows that the risk of transmission is significantly lower outdoors and this step will mean that people can see more of their friends, family and loved ones. However, as we take this small step forward, it is critical that those from different households continue to stay 2 metres apart. And it remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet. Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. The Prime Minister was clear today that people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission between lots of different families and continue to control the virus.
Those who are shielding should continue to do so. The Government recognises the toll this is taking on groups that have been asked to shield and hopes to say more soon on what further support we can provide. Speaking at today’s Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said – Thanks to the caution we have shown so far, all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus. So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional. They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe. And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. The new NHS Test and Trace programme will ensure we keep making progress in easing the lockdown while continuing to keep the virus under control. The government will closely monitor the impact of the changes set out today and continue to follow the scientific advice to ensure the five tests continue to be met before we take any further steps. So far, the public have shown high levels of compliance and we are confident that this will continue as restrictions are relaxed, and that people will do the right thing to control the virus and save lives. The police will continue to take the approach of engaging, explaining and encouraging individuals to follow the law. Where people do not follow the rules, the police will have the power to enforce these requirements as a last resort. The Prime Minister’s statement at today’s Downing Street press conference is here.

"32","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 June 2020",2020-06-03,"Coronavirus press conference 13 June 2020 First let me first run you through the latest data on our coronavirus response. 4,786,219 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK, including 171,829 tests yesterday. 279,856 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 1,871 cases since yesterday. 7,485 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 16% from 8,921 this time last week. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 39,728 have now died. That’s an increase of 359 fatalities since yesterday and once again we are with their families in mourning. Now that the rate of transmission in the UK has significantly fallen from its peak, we need to take steps to manage the flare-ups and stop the virus re-emerging in the UK. I want to update you on the progress we are making on three fronts to prevent a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. First, we have set up NHS Test and Trace in order to identify, contain and control the virus in the UK, thereby reducing its spread. As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. NHS Test and Trace will be vital to controlling the spread of the virus. It’s how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. It does this by identifying anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and asking them to isolate for 14 days in order to avoid unknowingly infecting others. The system clearly relies on everyone playing their part. So I want to stress again today: we need you to get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss of taste or smell. There is plenty of capacity and everyone with symptoms is eligible, everyone with symptoms, so please order a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus as soon as you develop symptoms. And we need you to isolate yourself if a contact tracer tells you that you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive. NHS Test and Trace started operating a week ago. And already thousands of people are isolating who wouldn’t have been doing so before this service was introduced. They are thereby protecting others and reducing the spread of the virus. So while we are going to all these efforts here in the UK to control the virus, we must also ensure we don’t reimport the virus from abroad. So the second action I want to update you on is the introduction of public health measures at the border. Today the Home Secretary has brought forward the legislation needed to establish the new regime from Monday. And I want to explain the reasons for introducing these measures now. When coronavirus started to spread around the world, first from Wuhan and then from northern Italy and other areas, we introduced enhanced monitoring at the border in an attempt to stop the virus from gaining a foothold in the UK. These measures applied, at various different times, to arrivals from China, Japan, Iran and Italy, and required people with symptoms travelling from those countries to self-isolate for 14 days. However, once community transmission was widespread within the UK, cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total. At the same time you’ll remember that international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown. So as a result, measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus. Now that we’re getting the virus under control in the UK, there’s a risk cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak. So just as we are asking people already in the UK to isolate for 14 days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we’re also asking those arriving from abroad to isolate so that they don’t unknowingly spread the virus. There will be some exemptions for a limited number of people who need to cross the border, such as those engaged directly in the fight against coronavirus or who provide essential services. And we will review how the policy is working after three weeks. And of course we will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection - but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so. The third point I want to make today is we need effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus across the globe. This is the moment really for humanity to unite in the fight against the disease. Health experts have warned that if coronavirus is left to spread in developing countries, that could lead to future waves of infection coming back and reaching the UK. While our amazing NHS has been there for everyone in this country who needs it, many developing countries have healthcare systems which are ill-prepared to manage this pandemic. So to ensure that the world’s poorest countries have the support they need to slow the spread of the virus, tomorrow I will open the Global Vaccine Summit. Hosted by the UK, and will bring together more than 50 countries and leading figures like Bill Gates to raise at least $7.4 billion for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Over the next five years – with the UK’s support as Gavi’s biggest donor – this Vaccine Alliance aims to immunise a further 300 million children in the poorest countries against deadly diseases like polio, typhoid and measles – again saving millions of lives. This support for routine immunisations will shore up poorer countries’ healthcare systems to deal with coronavirus – and so help to stop the global spread and, as I say, prevent a second wave of the virus reaching the UK. This virus has shown how connected we are. We’re fighting an invisible enemy. And no one is safe frankly until we are all safe. And again, of course this is all contingent upon each of us continuing to do our bit. And as I never tire of telling you Let us not forget the basics. Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds, wash your hands. Do not gather in groups of more than six outside. Always observe social distancing, keeping 2 metres apart from anyone outside your household. And I want to stress one final point which may be relevant today as the weather threatens I think to take a turn for the worse. Some of you may be tempted to move the gatherings you’ve been enjoying outdoors, indoors, out of the rain. I really urge you – don’t do that. We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason – because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors, much lower outdoors. And the risks of passing on the virus are significantly higher indoors, which is why gatherings inside other people’s homes are still prohibited. Breaking these rules now could undermine and reverse all the progress that we’ve made together. I have no doubt that that won’t happen, I’ve no doubt that that won’t happen. I think the British public will continue to show the same resolve in fighting the virus as they have throughout the outbreak. We will get through this if we stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-3-june-2020"
"33","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 June 2020",2020-06-10,"Coronavirus press conference 10 June 2020 Good evening,  two weeks ago, I set out the progress we as a country have made against our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and the measures we could introduce as a result. And today, I want to update you again on those five tests and set out some further changes we can now make. So can I have the first slide please? The five tests are designed, as you know, to ensure that any changes to the lockdown are careful, proportionate, and safe. They combine analysis of the latest data on the spread of the disease with assessments of how well we are placed to meet the operational challenges posed by the virus. We must do everything in our power to avoid a second peak of infection that overwhelms the NHS - because that would lead to more lives lost, more families in mourning, and more disruption to our economy and way of life. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. It’s thanks to the efforts of those working in the NHS that we can still be confident the NHS can cope. On 7 June, 443 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, down from 628 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April. And on 9 June, 492 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 848 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. So that means we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. And of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, I am sad to say that 41,128 have now died. That’s an increase of 245 fatalities since yesterday. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 200, down from 300 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. So the death rate has continued to fall, and so the second test is still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 290,143 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 1,003 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases found through testing is now 1,419, down from 2,416 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 in the first week of May. In a moment, Sir Patrick will talk us through SAGE’s latest assessment of the R and other evidence on infection rates. Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 170,379 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The total now stands at 6,042,622. Tomorrow the Health Secretary will provide an update on how NHS Test and Trace is performing. On PPE, we have secured over 150 deals with new suppliers around the world and procured 2.2 billion items of PPE to be manufactured domestically. Despite the immensely frustrating difficulties we have faced with PPE and testing in the past, this progress means we are now satisfied that the fourth test is being met - though of course we remain vigilant. Next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out – and on this basis I can confirm the Government judges we have met the fifth test. Therefore, the Government is satisfied that all five tests are still being met and we can proceed with the following further adjustments to the lockdown in England. A month ago I set out our roadmap to recovery and that explained the gradual steps we would take to ease the lockdown, as the data and the evidence allows. The measures it contained were all conditional on continued progress in tackling the virus. We are continuing to follow our roadmap, while adjusting our approach as we need to, as we always said we would. Although we are tackling this virus as one United Kingdom, it remains the case that the devolved administrations are responsible for lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it is right that they move at the right pace for them, according to their circumstances. For that reason, the specific measures I am about to set out apply in England only. First, on retail, shops. This has been the most challenging period for shops and high streets in our history. Never before have all shops been ordered to shut in this way. It has now been 82 days since we asked these shops to close their doors and I know the toll this has taken. Which is why I am so pleased that, as the Business Secretary confirmed yesterday, we can now allow all shops to reopen from Monday. It is vital that establishments should ensure they are meeting Covid Secure guidelines before they reopen. That way we can keep staff and customers safe while we get retail going. Second, on social contact. I know how difficult the past months have been for people cut off from their friends and family. Last Monday, we relaxed the rules on meeting outdoors so that groups of up to 6 could gather, provided they are socially distant. We did so in the knowledge that transmission of the virus is much lower outdoors, so we could make this change in a safe way. But there are still too many people, particularly those who live by themselves, who are lonely and struggling with being unable to see friends and family. From this weekend, we will allow single adult households - so adults living alone or single parents with children under 18 - to form a “support bubble” with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household - meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay 2 metres apart. I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive - meaning you cannot switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation. We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes - that remains against the law. Unfortunately, we cannot advise anyone who is shielding to form a support bubble at this stage, given their particular vulnerability to the virus. However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding, and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June. Third, on outdoor attractions. Because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, we can open up some more outdoor attractions for people to enjoy this summer. So from Monday, we will allow outdoor attractions where people can stay in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas to open. I am very grateful to the zoo industry for their cooperation and forbearance, and am happy to confirm that they too can reopen from Monday, provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards put in place. That includes keeping indoor areas such as reptile houses closed and facilitating social distancing. Finally, we will allow places of worship to open for individual prayer this weekend. And I hope that will be of some comfort to those of faith who have been unable to go to their place of worship. As set out in our roadmap, the next set of changes - Step 3 - will not begin until 4 July at the earliest, as the evidence allows. I know that these changes are only incremental and that some of you, many of you, may be hoping and waiting for more. I also know that people will once again find anomalies or apparent anomalies in what people can and cannot do. And as I have said before, I’m afraid that is just inevitable when we are only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy. We will continue to remain cautious and measure the effect of the changes that we make. And as I’ve always said, we won’t hesitate to apply the brakes if that is what the situation requires. That has meant moving slower than we would have liked in some areas. It is because the rate of infection is not yet quite low enough, and because we are not able to change our social distancing advice including smaller class sizes in schools, that we are not proceeding with our ambition to bring back all primary pupils at least for some weeks before the summer holidays. Instead we are working with teachers to bring back as many pupils as we can within those smaller class sizes. We do fully intend to bring all children back to school in September, provided the progress we are making continues, which I hope it will. That is our focus and it is consistent with the approach that has been taken by many other countries in Europe. In the meantime we must stick to our roadmap. I urge everyone to continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe. It’s only because of the restraint that everyone, you all have shown so far that we are able to move gradually out of this lockdown. So please, to repeat what you’ve heard so many times before, stay alert, maintain social distancing and keep washing your hands. Help control the virus by getting tested if you have symptoms and isolating if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace. Then, if we all do that together, we will all save lives and begin to rebuild our country. And I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-10-june-2020"
"34","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 June 2020",2020-06-16,"coronavirus press conference 16 June 2020 Good evening, I am delighted to be joined today by the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and by Professor Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health. Today I’m actually going to let them do most of the talking as they have some news to share on a new treatment for coronavirus. But I’ll start by updating you briefly on the latest data. Can I have the first slide please? 6,981,493 tests for coronavirus carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 113,107 carried out or posted out yesterday. 298,136 have tested positive, an increase of 1,279 cases since yesterday. The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals: 410 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 June, that’s down from 438 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. 385 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country: The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus: Although those figures are very sad, they do show that we are making good progress in controlling the spread of the virus. Tests are up and cases are down. Hospital admissions are down. The numbers of patients in hospital overall - and specifically those on mechanical ventilation beds - are both down. And of course while each death is one too many, deaths are coming down too. That progress of course has only been possible thanks to the dedication of the British people as we work together to beat this virus. By observing the lockdown, and sacrificing contact with friends and families, everybody has played their part in bringing the virus under control. It is critical now that we hold our nerve – and we don’t throw away the progress we have made. On the 11 May I set out our plan to help our country recover and we are working through it, carefully and deliberately. At each stage we have only proceeded when the evidence suggests it is safe to do so, ensuring our five tests for adjusting the lockdown continue to be met. And yesterday it was great to see our shops open their doors again. Our retail sector has done a fantastic job to make sure they are Covid Secure, meaning they can open in a safe way for staff and for customers. It is great to see so many people out shopping whilst observing social distancing – and that is so important to limiting the spread of the virus. It has also been very good to see more, and more children back at school this week, with some secondary pupils returning for face-to-face contact with their teachers ahead of the exams next year. And I want to say to all parents whose children are eligible to return to school, I want to assure you it is safe – and there is no need for your kids to miss out on their education, I hope they will go to school. I know that people want us to go further – with our changes to social distancing measures and I am all too aware the 2 metre rule has big implications for schools and many other sectors, and I absolutely hear those concerns and will do everything in my power to get us back to normal as soon possible. But we must proceed carefully, and according to our plan. I am still committed to the central goal to get back to life as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible… and in a way that minimises the risk of a new epidemic, minimises the risk to life and maximises our chances of a string economic and social recovery. Our plan sets out that the next step of adjusting lockdown - for personal care, for the hospitality and leisure sector, for gatherings in places of worship and other public places – a lot more to come and that as you know will happen no sooner than 4 July. I remain committed to that plan, and will say more soon about how we intend to take it forward. Today, the global efforts to find a long-term solution to the pandemic continue, through a vaccine or effective treatment. And I am delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK. I am not really qualified to announce on this drug and its effects but I will ask Sir Patrick and Professor Horby to say more in a moment. But I am so proud of these British scientists, backed by UK Government funding, who have led the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death. And I am very grateful to the thousands of patients in this country who volunteered for the trials – thank you. This drug - dexamethasone – can now be made available across the NHS. And we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak. Of course, while the chances of dying from Covid-19 have been significantly reduced by this treatment, they are still far too high. So we must redouble our research efforts and we certainly will. But today, there is genuine cause to celebrate a great, British achievement and the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world. I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-16-june-2020"
"35","PM announces easing of lockdown restrictions: 23 June 2020",2020-06-23,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has today (Tuesday 23 June) set out further changes to lockdown measures in England to enable people to see more of their friends and family, help businesses get back on their feet and get people back in their jobs. From Saturday 4th July, the Prime Minister has announced that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, providing they adhere to COVID Secure guidelines. From the same date, he has set out that two households will be able to meet up in any setting with social distancing measures, and that people can now enjoy staycations in England with the reopening of accommodation sites. In order to begin restoring the arts and cultural sector, some leisure facilities and tourist attractions may also reopen, if they can do so safely – this includes outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades, as well as libraries, social clubs, places of worship and community centres. Following a review, the Prime Minister has also set out that where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, guidance will allow people to keep a social distance of ‘one metre plus’. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. As we begin to reopen the economy, it’s important that we do not increase the risk of transmission which is why “close proximity” venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools, water parks, bowling alleys and spas will need to remain closed for now. The Government is continuing to work with these sectors to establish taskforces to help them to become COVID Secure and reopen as soon as possible. While the infection rate continues to fall, the Prime Minister has been clear that the public must continue to follow social distancing guidelines to keep coronavirus under control. The Government will keep all measures under constant review and will not hesitate to apply the handbrake, or reverse measures, should the virus begin to run out of control. These changes apply in England only.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-easing-of-lockdown-restrictions-23-june-2020"
"36","Prime Minister's statement to the House on COVID-19: 23 June 2020",2020-06-23,"Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of James Furlong, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and David Wails, who were brutally killed in Reading on Saturday. To assault defenceless people in a park is not simply an act of wickedness but abject cowardice, and we will never yield to those who would seek to destroy our way of life. Mr Speaker, with permission I will update the House on the next steps in our plan to rebuild our economy and reopen our society, while waging our struggle against Covid-19. From the outset, we have trusted in the common sense and perseverance of the British people and their response has more than justified our faith. Since I set out our plan on the 11th May, we have been clear that our cautious relaxation of the guidance is entirely conditional on our continued defeat of the virus. In the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK; by the first half of June, that total had fallen by nearly 70 percent to just under 22,000. The number of new infections is now declining by between 2 and 4 percent every day. Four weeks ago, an average of 1 in 400 people in the community in England had COVID-19; in the first half of June, this figure was 1 in 1,700. We created a human shield around the NHS and in turn our doctors and nurses have protected us, and together we have saved our hospitals from being overwhelmed. On the 11th May, 1,073 people were admitted to hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with Covid-19, by 20th June, this had fallen by 74 per cent to 283. This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost. Measured by a seven-day rolling average, the number of daily deaths peaked at 943 on the 14th April, on 11th May it was 476, and yesterday, the rolling average stood at 130. We have ordered over 2.2 billion items of protective equipment from UK based manufacturers, many of whose production lines have been called into being to serve this new demand - and yesterday, we conducted or posted 139,659 tests, bringing the total to over 8 million. And while we remain vigilant, we do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS. Taking everything together, we continue to meet our five tests and the Chief Medical Officers of all four home nations have downgraded the UK’s Covid Alert Level from four to three, meaning that we no longer face a virus spreading exponentially, though it remains in general circulation. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment, but all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need. Thanks to our progress, we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England. At every stage, caution will remain our watchword, and each step will be conditional and reversible. Mr Speaker, given the significant fall in the prevalence of the virus, we can change the two-metre social distancing rule, from 4th July. I know this rule effectively makes life impossible for large parts of our economy, even without other restrictions. For example, it prevents all but a fraction of our hospitality industry from operating. So that is why almost two weeks ago, I asked our experts to conduct a review and I will place a summary of their conclusions in the libraries of both Houses this week. Where it is possible to keep 2 metres apart people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of ‘one metre plus’, meaning they should remain one metre apart, while taking mitigations to reduce the risk of transmission. We are today publishing guidance on how businesses can reduce the risk by taking certain steps to protect workers and customers. These include, for instance, avoiding face-to-face seating by changing office layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, closing non-essential social spaces, providing hand sanitiser and changing shift patterns so that staff work in set teams. And of course, we already mandate face coverings on public transport. Whilst the experts cannot give a precise assessment of how much the risk is reduced, they judge these mitigations would make “1 metre plus” broadly equivalent to the risk at 2 metres if those mitigations are fully implemented. Either will be acceptable and our guidance will change accordingly. This vital change enables the next stage of our plan to ease the lockdown. Mr Speaker, I am acutely conscious people will ask legitimate questions about why certain activities are allowed and others are not. I must ask the House to understand that the virus has no interest in these debates. Its only interest, its only ambition is to exploit any opportunities is to recapture ground that we might carelessly vacate. There is one certainty: the fewer social contacts you have, the safer you will be. My duty, our duty as the Government, is to guide the British people, balancing our overriding aim of controlling the virus against our natural desire to bring back normal life. We cannot lift all the restrictions at once, so we have to make difficult judgments, and every step is scrupulously weighed against the evidence. Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks, remembering that the more we open up, the more vigilant we will need to be. From now on we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation. In that spirit we advise that from 4 July, two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out. That does not mean they must always be the same two households. It will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the following weekend. We are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission. Outside, the guidance remains that people from several households can meet in groups of up to six. and it follows that two households can also meet, regardless of size. Mr Speaker, I can tell the House that we will also re-open restaurants and pubs. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact. We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers, as happens in other countries, and we will work with the sector to make this manageable. Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will re-open hairdressers, with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors. We also intend to allow some other close contact services, such as nail bars, to re-open as soon as we can, when we are confident they can operate in a Covid-secure way. From 4th July, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed & breakfasts, as well as campsites as long as shared facilities are kept clean. Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely, including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres. “Close proximity” venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks. But my RHFs the Business and Culture Secretaries will establish taskforces with public health experts and these sectors to help them become Covid-secure and re-open as soon as possible. We will also work with the arts industry on specific guidance to enable choirs, orchestras and theatres to resume live performances as soon as possible. Recreation and sport will be allowed, but indoor facilities, including changing rooms and courts, will remain closed and people should only play close contact team sports with members of their household. Mr Speaker, I know that many have mourned the closure of places of worship, and this year, Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown. So I am delighted that places of worship will be able to reopen for prayer and services – including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing. Meanwhile, our courts, probation services, police stations and other public services will increasingly resume face-to-face proceedings. Wrap-around care for school age children and formal childcare will restart over the summer. Primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance and those children who can already go to school should do so – because it is safe. Mr Speaker, we will publish Covid-secure guidelines for every sector that is re-opening, and slowly but surely, these measures will restore a sense of normality. After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history, we are now able to make life easier for people to see more of their friends and families and to help businesses get back on their feet and get people back into work. But the virus has not gone away. We will continue to monitor the data with the Joint Biosecurity Centre and our ever more effective Test and Trace system. And I must be clear to the House, that as we have seen in other countries, there will be flare-ups for which local measures will be needed and we will not hesitate to apply the brakes and re-introduce restrictions even at national level - if required. So I urge everyone to stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Let’s keep washing our hands, staying 2 metres apart wherever feasible, and mitigating the risks at 1 metre where not, avoiding public transport when possible, and wearing a mask when not, getting tested immediately if we have symptoms, and self-isolating if instructed by NHS Test and Trace. Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our shops, streets and homes and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable. But it would be all too easy for that frost to return and that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through and see us to victory over this virus. I commend Mr Speaker this Statement to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-on-covid-19-23-june-2020"
"37","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 June 2020",2020-06-29,"The Prime Minister leading the coronavirus press conference on 23 June 2020 Good evening, Could I have the first slide please? On 16 April, we set out our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and since then they have guided our path out of lockdown. At every stage, we have diligently assessed our progress against these five tests before making changes. It has meant that we have, so far, avoided the catastrophe of a second peak of infection that could have overwhelmed the NHS and meant so many more lives lost. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. Well, the NHS has coped fantastically under the extraordinary pressure of this extraordinary pandemic. On 20 June, 283 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - down from 438 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. And on 22 June, 340 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. These numbers provide confidence that we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so that we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, it saddens me to report that 42,927 have now died. 171 fatalities were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm yesterday. A further 109 deaths which occurred in April, May and June have been identified and added to the total. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 121, down from 216 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. The second test is, therefore, still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 306,210 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 874 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases is now 1,147, down from 1,543 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 on 14 April. Approximately one in 1,700 people in the community in England are now estimated to have the virus, down from 1 in 400 four weeks ago. SAGE believes infections across the UK are shrinking at a steady rate of between 4 and 2 per cent every day. Based on all the various data available, the government is confident the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 237,142 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The new NHS Test and Trace service has already advised over 87,000 people to self-isolate who might otherwise have unwittingly transmitted the virus. We have contracted with over 175 new suppliers able to deliver PPE at the scale and pace the UK requires. And this progress means we are satisfied that the fourth test is being met. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am once again grateful for the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out. I can confirm the government judges we have met the fifth test and we are therefore satisfied that all five tests are still being met. On 11 May, we set out our plan to recover. That plan as you may remember set out three steps for adjusting the lockdown. Step 1 was implemented, as planned, on 13 May, enabling people to spend more time outdoors. Step 2 was implemented, as planned, in phases on    1 and 15 June. Shops have opened, children have started to return to school and people have been able to see more of their loved ones. Now Step 3 can be implemented, as planned, on 4 July. All the measures I am about to set out apply to England - the devolved administrations are responsible for adjusting lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, moving at the pace they believe is right for them. After a long period of asking you, the British public, to follow very strict and complex rules to bring coronavirus under control, we can now make life easier for people to see more of their friends and family, and to help businesses get back on their feet and people back into jobs. Critically, we can make a change to the guidance on two metres, which kept us safe while transmission of the virus was high but which can now be modified. Having considered all the evidence, while staying at two metres is preferable, we can now move to “1 metre plus” where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. These precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing handwashing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household, and of course being outdoors. On public transport, it means one metre plus wearing a face covering for mitigation, as everybody I think now understands. We are setting out COVID-Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them. We can also allow more sectors to reopen on 4 July, as planned for Step 3. So, from 4 July, the following premises will be allowed to reopen provided they are COVID-Secure: This has been an incredibly tough time for these establishments. But I hope that everyone working in them can take confidence in knowing they will be able to open their doors once again in just a couple of weeks’ time. And of course they should do so in a way that is COVID-Secure, keeping customers and staff safe. But I am afraid to say that some premises, such as nightclubs, swimming pools and indoor gyms, must remain closed for now given the particular risks of transmission in those settings. However, we are establishing taskforces for those sectors to establish how they too can open, in a COVID-Secure way, as fast as possible. At the same time, we can give people more freedom to see their friends and family. From 4 July, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time, including staying over. This can be indoors or outside, at your home, in a restaurant or pub, or in paid accommodation. I want to stress you should remain socially distant from anyone outside your household. For meeting outdoors, you can continue to meet in a park or a garden in a group of up to six people, drawn from six different households. Again, at all times you should maintain social distancing from anyone outside your household. As we give people back more control over their lives, we will be asking them to follow guidance on limiting their social contact, rather than forcing them to do so through legislation. And this obviously requires everyone to act responsibly, which I have no doubt they will do. It will still be possible for the police to break up large and irresponsible gatherings. But neither the police themselves, or the public that they serve, want virtually every aspect of our behaviour to be subject to the criminal law. Yesterday the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Health Secretary set out updated advice for those who are shielding in England, so that they can soon start to return to leading more normal lives. Opening up more of Britain in this COVID-Secure way is only possible if everyone continues to stay alert to the risks of coronavirus. That means you should: We are only able to make these changes because we have persevered together and stuck to our path. We had five tests - and we met them. We had a plan - and we stuck to it. The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and the people of this country have met that challenge with good humour and common sense. Of course, the fight is far from over. This is a nasty virus still that wants to take advantage of our carelessness. I’m afraid there will be local outbreaks. And I must tell you that if the virus were to begin to run out of control, I will not hesitate to put on the handbrake on and reverse some of these changes, at a local or indeed national level as required. But we can avoid that if we all continue to stay alert and do our bit to control the virus. The British public have proved again and again, not that it was ever in doubt it, that they can be trusted to do the right thing and to do it with common sense. There is no doubt we are beating back this virus and, with your continued cooperation and good judgment we will beat it once and for all. I’ll now hand over to Patrick.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-june-2020"
"38","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 July 2020",2020-07-03,"Good evening, Since I last spoke to you from this podium, we have continued to make progress nationally against the virus. We are now reporting regularly fewer than 1,000 new cases each day. The Office for National Statistics estimates that between 14 June and 27 June, the most recent period they have analysed, 25,000 people in the community in England had the virus – 1 person in every 2,200. SAGE assess that the R rate – the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto – remains between 0.7 and 0.9 across the UK. SAGE also assess that, in England, the number of new infections is shrinking by between 2 and 5% every day. And while the number of people dying with coronavirus remains too high, the numbers do continue to fall. Now of course this picture is not universal. There are areas – such as Leicester – where the virus is still more prevalent than we would like. We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I’m afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come. But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease. This progress is the reason why we have been able – slowly, carefully, cautiously – to ease the national lockdown. Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives – but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy. And of course, lockdown has not yet been lifted entirely. Indoor gyms, nail bars and swimming pools are still closed, mass gatherings are still prohibited, social distancing is still essential. I want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible – of course I do. We have established taskforces to work rapidly and closely with the sectors that remain closed to explore how they can be Covid Secure. I am pleased to report good progress is being made. Next week we will set out a timetable for their re-opening – though of course I can only lift those remaining, national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so. Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible – in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible. To achieve this we need to move away from blanket, national measures, to targeted, local measures. So instead of locking down the whole country, we will lock down specific premises or local areas where the virus is spreading. Instead of closing down non-essential retail and hospitality nationwide, we will only shut establishments locally as required. Instead of shutting all schools for most pupils, from September we will only shut those schools where it is absolutely necessary to control an outbreak. And instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is, sadly, not yet under control. We are already implementing this targeted approach in England. In Weston-Super-Mare, we identified an outbreak in a hospital, closed it to visitors and new admissions, tested all staff and patients and gave the hospital a deep clean. The outbreak was contained and the hospital is open again. In Kirklees, we identified an outbreak at a meat packing plant, shut down the plant, moved in a mobile testing unit, tested all employees and traced the contacts of those who were positive. The outbreak was contained and the plant has reopened with additional safety measures in place. And of course more recently in Leicester, we identified a community-wide outbreak which was not restricted to a single location, unlike Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees. Public Health England engaged with the local authority, mobile testing units were deployed, full data was shared – council-wide data was shared on 11 June, and postcode-level data was shared last week. This enhanced monitoring through additional testing showed that the infection rate in Leicester was three times the next highest infection rate in any other city in the country. So on Monday, the Health Secretary announced local lockdown measures in Leicester for an initial period of 2 weeks. In each of these cases, the problems identified were specific to Weston-Super-Mare, Kirklees and Leicester. So of course it made sense to take action locally, rather than re-impose restrictions on the whole country. And we are learning the whole time. With each local outbreak, we see what works well and what not so well, so that we do better next time. Informed by our experience of these cases, we have developed an approach for controlling future local outbreaks which has five principle components: monitoring, engagement, testing, targeted restrictions and finally, as a last resort, lockdown. First, monitoring. Public Health England, working with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, will examine carefully data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country. They will look out for emerging trends, rising case numbers and other indicators, while taking into account local factors. Critically, we have made local data available to all Directors of Public Health in local authorities, so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. And local data will also be available to the public on the gov.uk dashboard. Second, engagement. If monitoring identifies local problems, NHS Test and Trace and PHE will work with the relevant local authority to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and identify solutions. Working with local agencies, we will seek to keep the local community informed at every stage, so they know what is happening and what actions, if any, they need to take. Third, testing. We now have substantial testing capacity nationwide and we have the ability to target that capacity at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Scaled-up testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid more stringent measures. Fourth, targeted restrictions. If the virus continues to spread, we will restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises. As in Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees, we will restrict access to places which become hotspots for the virus, while testing people who have spent time in those places, and tracing the contacts of anyone who tests positive. Fifth, local lockdown. If the previous measures have not proven to be enough, we will introduce local lockdowns extending across whole communities. As in Leicester, that could mean shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be open, closing schools or urging people once more to stay at home. Local lockdowns will be carefully calibrated depending on the scientific and specific circumstances of each outbreak and we are continually exploring smarter means of containing the virus. So that is the approach we will take as local outbreaks occur and we will set out more detail soon. Let me end by looking forward to this weekend. Tomorrow, there will be a moment of remembrance for those whose lives have tragically been lost before their time. And at 5pm on Sunday, the NHS’s 72nd birthday, we can all come together to clap those who have worked tirelessly and selflessly to help the nation get through this pandemic. I know everyone will be looking forward to the relaxation of national restrictions. As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, B&Bs, indeed much of our tourism industry. All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down. Lockdown only succeeded in controlling the virus because everyone worked together, and we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together again. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that. If it starts running out of control again this Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions. Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal. So as we take this next step, our biggest step yet, on the road to recovery, I urge the British people to do so safely. Remember – don’t gather in groups of more than 6 outside or 2 households in any setting. Keep your distance from those outside your household – 2 metres if you can, 1 metre with precautions if you can’t. Wash your hands. Let’s all stay alert, control the virus, save lives – and enjoy summer safely.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-july-2020"
"39","Ventilator Challenge hailed a success as UK production finishes",2020-07-04,"Scientific modelling at the start of the coronavirus crisis predicted that the NHS was going to run out of ventilators, so the Government launched the Ventilator Challenge with a call to arms to manufacturers and medical device companies to step up production of existing designs and design new ventilators from scratch. The Government received an overwhelming response, with over 5000 companies offering their support and over 7500 members of staff contributing to the effort. Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of the British people, and to businesses across the United Kingdom in joining the national effort, the NHS has been protected throughout the coronavirus crisis and everyone who needed a ventilator has been able to access one. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: The Ventilator Challenge has proven just how much Britain can achieve when confronted with a difficult problem – bringing together the best minds in manufacturing, innovation and design. Thanks to these efforts, everyone who needed a ventilator has had access to one, and the NHS has the vital machines it needs to continue providing life-saving support against this deadly virus. UK production of ventilators under the Ventilator Challenge is to draw to a close this weekend with 14,000 devices expected to have been produced in around three months, accounting for over a half of all the ventilators now available to the NHS frontline. It has also been confirmed that the Penlon ventilator has had its CE mark confirmed, meaning that the device, which was newly adapted for the Ventilator Challenge, is now available for export abroad. Learning from their experiences of the Ventilator Challenge Penlon are now setting up a new line aimed at exporting across the world. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: The Ventilator Challenge has been a great success and I would like to thank every manufacturer and designer, and their incredible workforces, for the huge part they’ve played in the national effort to protect our NHS and save lives. In around three months, industry has stepped up to make 14,000 new machines to save lives on the NHS frontline and to help safeguard against any future outbreak. The Ventilator Challenge has shown that UK manufacturing always rises to the challenge at a time of national need. Everyone involved is truly a hero of the coronavirus crisis. The programme has formed a key part of a successful three pillar strategy to increase the number of mechanical ventilators, with over 25,000 devices now available in total to the NHS, up from 9,000 before the start of the pandemic. Over 2,500 have been imported from abroad. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: We protected the NHS during this global pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 showed the best and the brightest stepping forward to serve their country. The response the government received to this challenge was astonishing. Alongside the government’s wider ventilator strategy, the Ventilator Challenge has played a crucial role in ensuring everyone who has needed a ventilator during this pandemic has had access to one. The Government’s strategy involved procuring devices from overseas, scaling up the production of existing devices and calling on manufacturers who do not make ventilators, to help design and build new models. The Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three models (paraPAC, Vivo65 and Nippy4+) and helped guide one newly adapted model, the Penlon ESO 2, all the way through regulatory approval. A number of other UK manufacturers also progressed novel designs to advanced stages within weeks. Four of these designs, the Dyson/TTP CoVent, the Babcock Zephyr+, the Cambridge Consultants Veloci-Vent  and the Swagelok Piran Vent, were deemed to have achieved a performance level which met the MHRA’s requirements. The independent testing organisation (MD-TEC) concluded that they would have all been clinically usable as pandemic ventilators and could have supported large numbers of critically ill patients. Ultimately these designs were not progressed to mass production as part of the Ventilator Challenge due to reduced demand. Director of the Medical Devices Testing and Evaluation Centre, which tested the Ventilator Challenge devices, Dr Tom Clutton-Brock, said: Designing, manufacturing and testing ventilators usually takes years. So it’s outstanding the progress which has been made in a space of months. Having tested all of these devices, it’s impressive that several new models met the regulator’s requirements. These models would all have been clinically usable as pandemic ventilators and could have supported large numbers of critically ill patients. The NHS now has a readily available supply of devices that will enable the health service to have resilience of supply for possible future pandemics. Penlon and Smiths, who are part of the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium have so far delivered over 10,000 devices. Penlon is now making more ventilators in one day than the company used to deliver in ten months, further underlining the success of the scaling up of the device. The last Penlon and Smiths devices will be delivered this weekend, subject to final manufacturing and testing, and with the addition of the final Breas devices arriving in the coming weeks, we expect the Ventilator Challenge will produce a total of over 14,000 devices. In addition, today there are also around 11,000 non-invasive ventilators and almost 5,000 CPAP machines available to the NHS across the UK which were not available before the start of the crisis. Guru Krishnamoorthy, CEO Penlon said: It has been an amazing and humbling experience for Penlon to be a part of such a nationally important project. There is nothing more purposeful for a UK medical device company than rising to an occasion like this to save thousands of lives. Every member of Penlon has put in their best lifetime efforts into this project. We have been supported extremely well by the members and leaders of the Consortium companies, our suppliers and other business partners. We take this opportunity to thank each one of them. We wish the people of the UK and rest of the world a very safe and healthy life. We commit ourselves to do everything required and continue to provide high quality medical devices. Raffi Stepanian, CEO Breas Medical said: I would like to thank my colleagues, our suppliers and the UK Cabinet Office for the extraordinary efforts everyone has made to address the emergency need for ventilators and to support us to ramp up capacity. The ingenuity, commitment, pace and collaboration has been breathtaking and truly inspirational all against the backdrop of such demanding circumstances.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ventilator-challenge-hailed-a-success-as-uk-production-finishes"
"40","Audiences back in theatres from 1 August",2020-07-17,"Audiences adhering to social distancing will be able to return to indoor theatres, music and performance venues from 1 August, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced today. The announcement marks a major step in getting the arts and cultural sectors fully back up and running, and follows the government’s announcement of £1.57 billion of funding for the arts, culture and heritage sector earlier this month, the biggest ever one off investment in these industries. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is working with the sector on pilots of performances with socially distanced audiences that will inform final guidance for venues in the run up to August 1. These include the London Symphony Orchestra at St Luke’s, London with a variety of further events in the coming weeks. This announcement marks the move to stage 4 of the government’s 5-stage roadmap for the return of professional performing arts. Under the new regime, audiences, performers and venues will be expected to maintain social distancing at all times. Guidance for the performing arts, published earlier this month, also sets out further measures to support the safe return of audiences, including: The UK’s performing arts sector is renowned across the world and I am pleased that we are making real progress in getting its doors reopened to the public with social distancing. From August indoor theatres, music venues and performance spaces will safely welcome audiences back across the country. This is a welcome step in the path to a return to normal and, coupled with our £1.57 billion rescue package, will help secure the future of this important sector. Read the full guidance and further details of the £1.57 billion rescue package. Singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments in groups or in front of an audience is still currently limited to professionals only. This guidance will be for organisations in England. Organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should adhere to the advice of the devolved administrations at all times. This guidance will be updated as the evidence develops around singing, wind and brass instruments, and the wider public health context.
 
The five stages of the phased return to professional performing arts is as follows:","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/audiences-back-in-theatres-from-1-august"
"41","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 July 2020",2020-07-31,"PM statement on coronavirus 31 July 2020 Good afternoon, Two weeks ago, I updated you from this podium on the progress we had made as a country against coronavirus.
And in many ways that progress continues. The number of patients admitted to hospitals is still falling, and now stands at just over 100 each day.
In April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but now the latest figure is 87. The number of deaths continues to fall. That is obviously encouraging But I have also consistently warned that this virus could come back and that we would not hesitate to take swift and decisive action as required. I am afraid that in parts of Asia and Latin America the virus is now gathering pace. And our European friends are also struggling to keep the virus under control. As we see these rises around the world, we cannot fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble. Today, the weekly survey by the Office for National Statistics reports that the prevalence of the virus in the community in England is likely to be rising for the first time since May. Around 1 in 1,500 now have the virus, compared to 1 in 1,800 on 15 July and 1 in 2,000 on 2 July. The ONS also estimate there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on 14 July and 2,000 per day at the end of June We can’t afford to ignore this evidence. It’s vital to stress that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic – because we know so much more about the virus and have so many more tools at our disposal to deal with it. Our testing capacity has increased 100-fold. We have a contact tracing system up and running which has led to over 184,000 people isolating who may otherwise have spread the virus and is capable of tracing thousands of contacts every day. We have secured supplies of billions of items of PPE to withstand new demands on hospitals and care homes. And of course we have new treatments, like dexamethasone and remdesivir, to shorten recovery times and reduce mortality rates. But as I say, we cannot be complacent. I cannot – I won’t stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country. Last night the Health Secretary announced new restrictions on household contact in the North West – specifically Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire. These are targeted measures on social contact between households, which the data tells us is driving the current increase in cases. Businesses and workplaces should continue as before in those areas.I know how it is hard to have restrictions like this imposed on seeing your family and your friends. But we have to act rapidly in order to protect those we love. And we know this sort of intervention works – measures taken in Leicester and Luton have suppressed the virus, allowing us to relax measures. Even as we act locally, it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures we have in place nationally in light of the data we are seeing about incidence. At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required. With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed. Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight. That means that, until 15 August at the earliest: Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed.
Indoor performances will not resume. Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place. Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with COVID-Secure guidelines. I know that the steps we are taking will be a heavy blow to many people – to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted, or who now cannot celebrate Eid in the way they would wish, I am really, really sorry about that. But we simply cannot take the risk. We will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can. Two weeks ago, I also said that from tomorrow the government would give employers more discretion over how employees can work safely – whether by continuing to work from home or attending a Covid Secure workplace. We know that employers have gone to huge lengths to make workplaces safe, so that guidance remains unchanged.
We also said we would pause shielding nationally from 1 August – based on clinical advice, that national pause will proceed as planned, and our medical experts will be explaining more about that decision later and about shielding later today. Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus. But we must keep our discipline, we must be focused and we cannot be complacent. I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced. That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance. And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law.
We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.
We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from 8 August. At this stage, we are not changing the rules on social contact nationally. I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further.
Two weeks ago, I said we would hope for the best but plan for the worst. And of course we continue to hope for the best. The way to get there and to achieve that optimum outcome is if we all follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance – and get a test if we have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control. This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown. We’ve made huge progress together. I know we are going succeed and I know we are going to beat this – if each and every one of us plays our part.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-july-2020"
"42","Standing side by side, we'll build back better than ever",2020-08-13,"The rainbow balloon stickers that still doggedly adhere to seemingly every commercial vehicle in the greater Belfast area brought a much-needed splash of colour and a sizeable serving of hope to the people of Northern Ireland during the toughest days of the Coronavirus lockdown. Sam McClean, the Belfast sign-maker who has been churning them out non-stop since April, has already raised north of £100,000 for the NHS and local charities – for which I was delighted to give him a special Point of Light award earlier this year. And while the stickers he has produced say a well-deserved “thank-you” to our amazing key workers, the way in which they rapidly spread to every part of Northern Ireland also says something about the way in which the people of this country pulled together in the fight against this awful virus. About the way dividing lines that have existed in the past simply ceased to matter in the face of a foe that cares nothing for politics or faith. In the kind of cross-community co-operation that the late John Hume spent his life promoting, we saw all the people of Northern Ireland coming together and looking out for one another, demonstrating quite remarkable levels of compassion, resilience and good humour. From manufacturers of baby equipment to distillers of gin, businesses across the country turned their hands to creating handwash, face masks, ventilators and more. And, just as Northern Ireland faced Coronavirus as one people, so the four nations of the UK faced it as one Union. Our combined strength and economic heft has allowed us to share and shoulder a burden that would have otherwise proved unbearable. What does that look like? It looks like almost a quarter of a million people across Northern Ireland having their jobs supported by the UK government’s relief schemes. It looks like nearly five million items of PPE committed to Northern Ireland from UK resources, and 250,000 medical-grade gowns heading from Northern Irish suppliers to frontline workers in England. Millions of pounds of support to keep Derry and Belfast airports open and vital air links running during the worst of the lockdown. And, as the Chancellor recently announced, at least £2.2 billion of additional funding for the Northern Ireland Executive this year. This is the kind of alchemy that happens when Stormont and Westminster work together, hand-in-glove. And I cannot overstate how important it is that this close co-operation continues as we strive to not simply rebuild in the wake of Coronavirus, but to come back stronger than ever, bigger than ever, better than ever and ready to take advantage of the innumerable opportunities that lie ahead. So when I meet with the First Minister and deputy First Minister today I won’t only be talking about the ongoing pandemic, vital though the fight against it remains. I’ll be talking about the unique freedoms Northern Ireland will enjoy when the Brexit transition period comes to an end in five months from now. About the £562 million City and Growth Deal programme, bringing opportunity and prosperity not just to Belfast but every part of Northern Ireland. And about our hugely exciting plans for marking Northern Ireland’s centenary – using UK Government funding from the New Decade, New Approach package to support a programme of events that will help people across the UK and around the world celebrate Northern Ireland and its integral place within the United Kingdom. All of these are serious issues for Northern Ireland’s leaders, yes. But they are also just as important to me as what’s going on in London or Liverpool or Leeds. Because this government has an unshakeable commitment to each and every person in each and every nation of our United Kingdom. And, just as we continue to fight Coronavirus together, so we will stand side by side as we build back better, constructing the kind of exciting, strong, prosperous Northern Ireland that all of us want to see.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/standing-side-by-side-well-build-back-better-than-ever"
"43","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 September 2020",2020-09-09,"PM press conference statement 9 September 2020 Good afternoon, Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter. I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it. Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act. The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics. First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital. Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others. Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings. Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain. We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t. So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms. Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family. I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public. In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce. I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family. So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law. This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub. The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested. This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6. There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather. COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups. Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed. As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people. I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives. We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary. I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe. In future: At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly. Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown. By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure. I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school. Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe. University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low. Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts. Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students. The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality. Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees. So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing. Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus. And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day. That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing: Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious.
Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID.
Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released.
Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide. There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges. And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it. Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more. Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock. We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas. But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made. That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now. I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long. So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space. I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-9-september-2020"
"44","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 22 September 2020",2020-09-22,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our response to the rising number of Coronavirus cases and how we must act now to avoid still graver consequences later on. At every stage in this pandemic we have struck a delicate balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS and minimising the wider impact of our restrictions. And it is because of the common sense and fortitude of the British people that earlier this year we were able to avert an even worse catastrophe, forming a human shield around our NHS, and then by getting our country moving again by reopening key sectors of our economy and returning children to school. But we always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. And I am sorry to say that - as in Spain and France and many other countries - we have reached a perilous turning point. A month ago, on average around a thousand people across the UK were testing positive for Coronavirus every day. The latest figure has almost quadrupled to 3,929. Yesterday the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser warned that the doubling rate for new cases could be between seven and 20 days with the possibility of tens of thousands of new infections next month. I wish I could reassure the House that the growing number of cases is merely a function of more testing, but a rising proportion of the tests themselves are yielding a positive result. I also wish I could say that more of our people now have the antibodies to keep the virus off, but the latest data suggest that fewer than 8 per cent of us are in this position. It is true that the number of new cases is growing fastest amongst those aged 20-29, but the evidence shows that the virus is spreading to other more vulnerable age groups, as we have seen in France and Spain where this has led to increased hospital admissions and, sadly, more deaths. In the last fortnight, daily hospital admissions in England have more than doubled. Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act. And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter. Yesterday, on the advice of the four Chief Medical Officers, the UK’s Covid alert level was raised from 3 to 4, the second most serious stage, meaning that transmission is high or rising exponentially. So this is the moment when we must act. If we can curb the number of daily infections, and reduce the Reproduction rate to 1, then we can save lives, protect the NHS, and the most vulnerable, and shelter the economy from the far sterner and more costly measures that would inevitably become necessary later. So we are acting on the principle that a stitch in time saves nine. The Government will introduce new restrictions in England, carefully judged to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number with the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods. I want to stress that this is by no means a return to the full lockdown of March. We are not issuing a general instruction to stay at home. We will ensure that schools, colleges and universities stay open - because nothing is more important than the education, health and well-being of our young people. We will ensure that businesses can stay open in a Covid-compliant way. However, we must take action to suppress the disease. First, we are once again asking office workers who can work from home to do so. In key public services – and in all professions where homeworking is not possible, such as construction or retail – people should continue to attend their workplaces. And like Government, this House will be free to take forward its business in a Covid-secure way which you, Mr Speaker, have pioneered. Second, from Thursday all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate table-service only, Mr Speaker, except for takeaways. Together with all hospitality venues, they must close at 10pm. To help the police to enforce this rule, I am afraid that means alas closing, and not just calling for last orders. Simplicity is paramount. The same will apply to takeaways - though deliveries can continue thereafter. I am sorry this will hurt many businesses just getting back on their feet, but we must act to stop the virus from being transmitted in bars and restaurants. Third, we will extend the requirement to wear face coverings to include staff in retail, all users of taxis and private hire vehicles, and staff and customers in indoor hospitality, except when seated at a table to eat or drink. Fourth, in retail, leisure, tourism and other sectors, our Covid-secure guidelines will become legal obligations. Businesses will be fined and could be closed if they breach these rules. Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six. I’m afraid that from Monday, a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions. Though, up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now. We will also have to extend the rule of six to all adult indoor team sports. Finally, we have to acknowledge that the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen business conferences, exhibitions and large sporting events so we will not be able to do this from 1 October. And I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities, and my RH Friends the Chancellor and Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them. Mr Speaker, these rules measures will only work if people comply. There is nothing more frustrating for the vast majority, the law-abiding majority that do comply than the sight of a few brazenly defying the rules. So these rules will be enforced by tighter penalties. We have already introduced a fine of up to £10,000 for those who fail to self-isolate and such fines will now be applied to businesses breaking Covid rules. The penalty for failing to wear a mask or breaking the rule of six will now double to £200 for a first offence. We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need, a greater police presence on our streets, and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police. The measures I have announced all apply in England and the Devolved Administrations are taking similar steps. I spoke yesterday with each of the First Ministers and again today and I thank them for their collaboration: the health of everyone in these islands depends on our common success. Already about 13 million people across England are living under various local restrictions, over and above national measures. We will continue to act against local flare-ups, working alongside councils and strengthening measures where necessary.
And I want to speak directly to those who were shielding early in the pandemic and may be anxious about being at greater risk.
Following advice from our senior clinicians, our guidance continues to be that you do not need to shield – except in local lockdown areas – and we will keep this under constant review.
I must emphasise that if all our actions fail to bring the R below 1, then we reserve the right to deploy greater firepower, with significantly greater restrictions. I fervently want to avoid taking this step, as do the Devolved Administrations, but we will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes. Mr Speaker, we will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments and new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress, we should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months. For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue. We will not listen to those who say let the virus rip; nor to those who urge a permanent lockdown; we are taking decisive and appropriate steps to balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods. I know all of this will have profound consequences for our constituents, so the government will give the House every opportunity to scrutinise our decisions. In addition to regular statements and debates, Hon Members will be able to question the government’s scientific advisers more regularly, gain access to data about their constituencies, your constituencies and join daily calls with my RH Friend the Paymaster General. After six months of restrictions, it would be tempting to hope that the threat has faded, and seek comfort in the belief that if you have avoided the virus so far then you are somehow immune. I have to say that it is that kind of complacency that could be our undoing. If we fail to act together now we will not only place others at risk but jeopardise our own futures with the more drastic action that we would inevitably be forced to take. Mr Speaker, no British government would wish to stifle our freedoms in the ways that we have found necessary this year. Yet even now we can draw some comfort from the fact that schools and universities and places of worship are staying open, shops can serve their customers, construction workers can go to building sites, and the vast majority of the UK economy can continue moving forwards. We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave, with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing. So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules. Then we can fight back against this virus, shelter our economy from even greater damage, protect the most vulnerable in care homes and hospitals, safeguard our NHS and save many more lives. And I commend this statement to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-22-september-2020"
"45","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 September 2020",2020-09-22,"PM address the nation on coronavirus 22 September Good evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-september-2020"
"46","Prime Minister: World must unite to defeat COVID and prevent future pandemics",2020-09-25,"The world must overcome the extraordinary divisions created by coronavirus and unite to defeat the pandemic, the Prime Minister will tell the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) today [Saturday]. In his virtual address to the Assembly, Boris Johnson will announce a series of new measures to help lead the world out of the crisis and set out an ambitious five-point plan to prevent future pandemics. The plan, developed in consultation with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Wellcome Trust, starts with a proposal to develop a worldwide network of ‘zoonotic hubs’ to identify dangerous pathogens before they leap from animals to humans, as COVID-19 is believed to have done. Other measures include boosting manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines, improving pandemic early warning systems, agreeing global protocols for health crises and removing trade barriers. The Prime Minister will also announce significant new investment in COVAX, the international COVID-19 vaccines procurement pool. The UK will contribute an initial £71 million to secure purchase rights for up to 27 million vaccine doses for the UK population. This complements other initiatives by the Government to procure any coronavirus vaccine that proves to be safe and effective. Alongside the domestic investment the UK will commit £500 million in aid funding for the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a facility to help 92 of the world’s poorest countries access a coronavirus vaccine. The funding will support developing countries in tackling the virus and help to halt the global spread of the pandemic, keeping us all safer. As he addresses the UN General Assembly, the Prime Minister will say: After nine months of fighting Covid, the very notion of the international community looks tattered. We know that we cannot continue in this way. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. Now is the time therefore – here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA -  for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. Here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world’s first vaccine, we are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN to heal those divisions and to heal the world. To ensure we are match-fit for other global health crises, the Prime Minister will also announce the UK’s pledge of £340 million over the next four years to the World Health Organization – an increase of 30% from the previous 4-year period, making Britain one of the largest donors. Funding for the WHO will support its vital work in fighting threats to our health worldwide. It will also help to fund an in-depth review into the origins of coronavirus and the implementation of necessary reforms to ensure the WHO is flexible and responsive in future emergencies. Boris Johnson will pledge to use the UK’s G7 presidency next year to work with our global partners to implement the five-point plan, which represents an innovative new approach to preventing global health crises. The proposals he will make today are: Set up a worldwide network of zoonotic research hubs to spot a new pandemic before it starts. About 60% of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a ‘zoonotic’ transmission. Zoonotic research centres would be charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens before they cross the species barrier and infect human beings. Develop manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines. A strong manufacturing capability, in the UK and around the world, will mean tried and tested treatments and vaccines can be held ready to deploy against emerging threats. Design a global pandemic early warning system to predict a coming health crisis. This would require a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. Agree global protocols ready for a future health emergency. In the coronavirus pandemic, countries have fought 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. A common set of protocols, covering everything from information sharing to PPE supplies, would allow us to respond more cohesively and effectively. Reduce the trade barriers which have impeded the coronavirus response. Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Tariffs on key goods like soap can exceed 30%. The UK has committed to lifting tariffs on many COVID-critical products from 1 January. In addition to addressing global health issues at UNGA, the Prime Minister is urging international action on climate change and biodiversity. He will address 2 UNGA events on biodiversity next week.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-world-must-unite-to-defeat-covid-and-prevent-future-pandemics"
"47","Prime Minister's speech to United Nations General Assembly: 26 September 2020",2020-09-26,"Watch the Prime Minister’s speech Never in the history of our species – not since the Almighty felled the Tower of Babel – has the human race been so obsessed with one single topic of conversation. We have been following the same debates, researching the potential of the same drugs, and time and again we have been typing the same word into our search engines. COVID-19, coronavirus, has united humanity as never before. And yet the crisis has also been an extraordinary force for division. We have all been up against the same enemy. The same tiny opponent threatening everyone in much the same way, but members of the UN have still waged 193 separate campaigns, as if every country somehow contains a different species of human being. Across the world there has been an infinite variety of curfews and restrictions and closures, and we have fought in a spirit of sauve qui peut. And the pace has been so urgent and the pressures so intense that each national government – democracy or otherwise – has decided entirely understandably to put the interests of its domestic population first. We have seen borders spring up between friends and allies, sometimes without consultation. We have seen the disruption of global supply chains with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE. And after 9 months of fighting COVID-19, the very notion of the international community looks, frankly, pretty tattered. And we know that we simply can’t continue in this way. Unless we get our act together. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. The inevitable outcome would be to prolong this calamity and increase the risk of another. Now is the time – therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA –  for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. Let’s heal the world – literally and metaphorically. And let’s begin with the truth, because as someone once said, the truth shall set you free. And with nearly a million people dead, with colossal economic suffering already inflicted and more to come, there is a moral imperative for humanity to be honest and to reach a joint understanding of how the pandemic began, and how it was able to spread – Not because I want to blame any country or government, or to score points. I simply believe – as a former COVID patient – that we all have a right to know, so that we can collectively do our best to prevent a recurrence. And so the UK supports the efforts of the World Health Organisation and of my friend, Tedros, to explore the aetiology of the disease, because however great the need for reform, the WHO, the World Health Organization, is still the one body that marshals humanity against the legions of disease. That is why we in the UK – global Britain – are one of the biggest global funders of that organisation, contributing £340 million over the next 4 years, that’s an increase of 30%. And as we now send our medical detectives to interview the witnesses and the suspects – bats, the pangolins, whoever – we should have enough humility to acknowledge that alarm bells were ringing before this calamity struck. In the last 20 years, there have been 8 outbreaks of a lethal virus, any of which could have escalated into a pandemic. Bill Gates sounded the alert in 2015, 5 years ago he gave that amazing prediction – almost every word of which has come true – and we responded as if to a persistent Microsoft error message by clicking ‘ok’ and carrying on. Humanity was caught napping. We have been scrabbling to catch up, and with agonising slowness we are making progress. Epidemiologists at Oxford University identified the first treatment for COVID-19. They did trials with our national health service and found that a cheap medicine called dexamethasone reduces the risk of death by over a third for patients on ventilators. The UK immediately shared this discovery with the world, so that as many as 1.4 million lives could be saved in the next six months by this one, single advance. And as I speak there are 100 potential vaccines that are trying to clear the hurdles of safety and efficacy, as if in a giant global steeplechase. We don’t know which may be successful. We do not know if any of them will be successful. The Oxford vaccine is now in stage 3 of clinical trials, and in case of success AstraZeneca has already begun to manufacture millions of doses, in readiness for rapid distribution,  and they have reached agreement with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses to low and middle-income countries. But it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage and immoral to seek a head start through obtaining research by underhand means. The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about. We are already the biggest single donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness to find a vaccine. And it is precisely because we know that no-one is safe until everyone is safe, that I can announce that the UK will contribute up to £571 million to COVAX, a new initiative designed to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine across the world. Of this sum, £500 million will be for developing countries to protect themselves. The UK is already the biggest donor to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In June we helped to raise almost $9 billion to immunise another 300 million children against killer diseases, and Gavi also stands ready to help distribute a COVID-19 vaccine. But even as we strive for a vaccine, we must never cut corners, slim down the trials or sacrifice safety to speed. Because it would be an absolute tragedy if in our eagerness, we were to boost the nutjobs – the anti vaxxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives. And now is the time above all to look ahead and think now about how to stop a pandemic from happening again. How can we stop another virus from coming along and again smashing that precious Ming vase of international cooperation?  How can we avoid the mutual quarantines and the brutal Balkanisation of the world economy? I don’t think there is any reason for fatalism: of course, the dangers can never be wholly eliminated, but human ingenuity and expertise can reduce the risk.  Imagine how much suffering might have been avoided if we had already identified the pathogen that became COVID-19 while it was still confined to animals? Suppose we had been able to reach immediately into a global medicine chest and take out a treatment? What if countries had been ready to join together from the outset to develop and trial a vaccine? And think how much strife would have been prevented if the necessary protocols – covering quarantine and data-sharing and PPE and so much else – had, so far as possible, been ready on the shelf for humanity to use? So we in the UK we’re going to work with our friends, we’re going to use our G7 presidency next year to create a new global approach to health security based on a 5-point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic. Our first aim should be to stop a new disease before it starts. About 60% of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a ‘zoonotic’ transmission. The world could seek to minimise the danger by forging a global network of zoonotic research hubs, charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens that may cross the species barrier and infect human beings. The UK is ready to harness its scientific expertise and cooperate to the fullest extent with our global partners to this end. Of the billions of pathogens, the great mass are thankfully incapable of vaulting the species barrier. Once we discover the dangerous ones, our scientists could get to work on identifying their weaknesses and refining anti-viral treatments before they strike. We could open the research to every country and as we learn more, our scientists might begin to assemble an armoury of therapies – a global pharmacopoeia – ready to make the treatment for the next COVID-19. Our second step should be to develop the manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines So that the whole of humanity can hold them like missiles in silos ready to zap the alien organisms before they can attack. But if that fails and a new disease jumps from animals to human beings and overcomes our armoury of therapies and begins to spread, then we need to know what’s going on as fast as possible. So the third objective should be to design a global pandemic early warning system, based on a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. As far as possible, we should aim to predict a pandemic almost as we forecast the weather to see the thunderstorm in the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand. And if all our defences are breached, and we face another crisis, we should at least be able to rely on our fourth step, and have all the protocols ready for an emergency response, covering every relevant issue, along with the ability to devise new ones swiftly. Never again must we wage 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. As with all crises, it is crucial not to learn the wrong lessons. After the harrowing struggle to equip ourselves with enough ventilators – with countries scrabbling to improvise like the marooned astronauts of Apollo 13 – there is a global movement to onshore manufacturing. That is understandable. Here in the UK we found ourselves unable to make gloves, aprons, enzymes which an extraordinary position for a country that was once the workshop of the world. We need to rediscover that latent gift and instinct, but it would be insane to ignore the insights of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. We need secure supply chains – but we should still rely on the laws of comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market.  Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Governments still target their trade barriers on exactly what we most need to combat the virus, with tariffs on disinfectant often exceeding 10%, and for soap tariffs for 30%. So I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible – and agree not to revive them – and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: gloves, protective equipment, thermometers and other COVID-critical products. The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same. Though the world is still in the throes of this pandemic, all these steps are possible if we have the will. They are the right way forward for the world, and Britain is the right country to give that lead. And we will do so in 2021, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this great United Nations in London in January, and through our G7 Presidency, and as we host the world’s climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow next November. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an immense psychic shock to the human race. Global fears have been intensified by the immediacy of round the clock news and social media. We sometimes forget, we face a virus – a small package of nucleic acid that simply replicates. It is not even technically alive. Tragic as its consequences have been, it has been nothing like as destructive as other plagues – let alone the influenza of a century ago. It is absurd, in many ways, outrageous that this microscopic enemy should have routed the unity of the human race. COVID-19 has caused us to cease other vital work, and I’m afraid it made individual nations seem selfish and divided from each other. Every day people were openly encouraged to study a grisly reverse Olympic league table, and to take morbid and totally mistaken comfort in the greater sufferings of others. We cannot go on like that, we cannot make these mistakes again. And here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world’s first vaccine We are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN, to heal those divisions and to heal the world.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-to-un-general-assembly-26-september-2020"
"48","COVID-19 Honours",2020-09-27,"Doctors, nurses, fundraisers and volunteers who have made outstanding contributions to the UK’s coronavirus response will be recognised in the 2020 Queen’s Birthday Honours list on Saturday 10 October. The list, which was due to be published in June, was postponed in order to consider nominations for people playing crucial roles during the first months of the COVID-19 effort. Now, following approval from Her Majesty the Queen, hundreds of additional people will be honoured for their contributions tackling the virus on the frontline and in their communities. They will appear alongside recipients that were already due to be recognised for a broad range of achievements before the pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: As we all redouble our efforts to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives this Winter, I am pleased we have an opportunity to recognise those who have given so much to this country already. The coronavirus pandemic is the greatest health challenge in our lifetime. We all have to play our part, but the dedication, courage and compassion seen from these recipients, be it responding on the frontline or out in their communities providing support to the most vulnerable, is an inspiration to us all. We owe them a debt of gratitude and the 2020 Queen’s Birthday honours will be the first of many occasions where we can thank them as a nation. This year’s bumper list follows the Prime Minister’s call in May for nominations for those going over and above in response to the pandemic. As the first list to incorporate COVID-19 nominations during the ongoing pandemic, the 2020 Queen’s Birthday list has prioritised frontline and community heroes. These recipients, like Captain Sir Tom Moore, are outstanding examples of the contributions which still being made right across the UK, and are symbolic of the ongoing, collective national effort. The honours system is just one of the ways in which tribute will be paid to people across the country for their efforts in response to COVID-19.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-honours"
"49","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 September 2020",2020-09-30,"When I spoke to you all last week I explained that the number of Covid patients going into hospital had doubled in a fortnight and I explained that the rate of infections was climbing steeply. I said that we faced the sad reality that on these figures we could expect many more daily deaths. And so that’s why we announced the package of restrictions and stronger enforcement last week. At the same time we’ve been intensifying the local lockdowns in areas where the disease has been flaring up. I want to say - I know how tough it is and has been for these communities and I want to pay a particular tribute to the students who are experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined. I can assure you, assure everybody at university, that plans are being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas. I wish I could tell you tonight that the impact of this package has already begun to appear but it will take time to feed through. And yesterday we saw the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, today a further 7,108. We’ve also had a tragic increase in the number of daily deaths – with 71 yesterday and again today. And these figures show why our plan is so essential We now have to stick to it together - and we should stick to it with confidence, because there are many ways in which we are far better prepared than we were in March. We are on track to hit our target of being able to conduct 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, We’re already exceeding the number of tests per capita that are conducted in Germany, France and Spain. We have over 2,000 beds that could be available across seven Nightingale hospitals, and we will be able to go further if needed. We’ve ordered 32 billion items of PPE, and we’ll have a four month stockpile of masks, visors, gowns and other essentials for winter. By December, by the way, we expect UK manufacturers will meet 70 per cent of the demand for PPE compared with just one per cent before the pandemic. And in the last six months we have more than trebled the availability of mechanical ventilators to our NHS across the UK to 31,500. But the best way forwards, to protect the NHS, save lives, to keep our children in school and the economy moving, is to follow the rules wherever we live. So I want to thank everyone for the fantastic national effort that we are seeing, continuing to see And no matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become there is only one way of doing this, and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others. At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences. And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now But if we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree. And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do. Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions. But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care. That’s why we must bear down on the virus now, so that we never reach that point, and I am absolutely confident that with ever increased testing, with better treatments and of course with the prospect of a vaccine, we will get through this. So let’s follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing, download the app, as 14 million of you have already done, and together we will fight back against this virus, protect our NHS and save many more lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-september-2020"
"50","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 12 October 2020",2020-10-12,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our continuing fight against coronavirus and how we intend to fulfil our simultaneous objectives saving lives, protecting the NHS while keeping our children in school and our economy running, and protecting jobs and livelihoods This morning the Deputy Chief Medical Officer set out the stark reality of the second wave of this virus the number of cases has quadrupled in the last three weeks there are now more people in hospital with Covid than when we went into lockdown on March 23 and deaths are already rising and of course there are those who say that on that logic we should go back into a full national lockdown of indefinite duration closing schools and businesses telling people again to stay at home as we did in March once again shuttering our lives and our society I do not believe that would be the right course, We would not only be depriving our children of their education we would do such damage to our economy as to erode our long term ability to fund the NHS and other crucial public services And on the other side of the argument there are those who think that the patience of the public is now exhausted and that we should abandon the fight against Covid stand aside, let nature take her course, and call a halt to these repressions of liberty and of course I understand those emotions I understand the frustration of those who have been chafing under the restrictions, the sacrifices they have made But if we were to follow that course Mr Speaker, and let the virus rip, then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid, We would put such huge strain on our NHS, with an uncontrolled second spike that our doctors and nurses would be simply unable to devote themselves to the other treatments for cancer, for heart disease and hundreds more that have already been delayed and that would be delayed again with serious long term damage to the health of the nation and I am afraid it is no answer to say that we could let the virus take hold among the young and fit while shielding the elderly and vulnerable because the virus would then spread with such velocity in the general population that there would be no way of stopping it from spreading among the elderly and even if the virus is less lethal for the under 60s there will still be many younger people for whom, alas, it remains lethal So Mr Speaker, we don’t want to go back to another national lockdown We can’t let the virus rip and so we have followed since June a balanced approach with the support of many Members across the House to keeping the R down while keeping schools and the economy going and controlling the virus by changing our behaviour so as to restrict its spread That is why we have the Rule of Six, and why we have restrictions such as a 10pm closing time on our hospitality sector. Mr Speaker, I take no pleasure whatsoever in imposing restrictions on these businesses, many of which have gone to great lengths to reopen as safely as possible. Nor do I want to stop people enjoying themselves, but we must act to save lives. And the evidence shows that in changing our behaviour in restricting transmission between us our actions are saving lives. Left unchecked each person with the virus will infect on average between 2.7 and 3 others but SAGE assess that the current R nationally is between 1.2 and 1.5. So we are already suppressing that R to well below its natural level which is why the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in March. But we need to go further. In recent months, we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions. But this local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country that are now complex to understand and enforce. So just as we simplified our national rules with the Rule of Six, we will now simplify and standardise our local rules by introducing a three tiered system of local Covid Alert Levels in England - set at medium, high, and very high. The “medium” alert level, which will cover most of the country, and will consist of the current national measures. This includes the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. The “high” alert level reflects the interventions in many local areas at the moment. This primarily aims to reduce household to household transmission, by preventing all mixing between different households or support bubbles indoors. In these areas, the Rule of Six will continue to apply outdoors, where it is harder for the virus to spread, in public spaces as well as private gardens. Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into the “high” alert level. As a result of rising infection rates, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move into the “high” alert level. The “very high” alert level will apply where transmission rates are rising most rapidly and where the NHS could soon be under unbearable pressure without further restrictions. In these areas the government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens and, I’m sorry to say, closing pubs and bars, We want to create the maximum possible local consensus behind this more severe local action, so in each area, we will work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken. This could lead to further restrictions on the hospitality, leisure, entertainment or personal care sectors. But retail, schools and universities will remain open. As my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor has set out, the government will expand its unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks. We will also provide Local Authorities across England with around £1 billion of new financial support, on top of our £3.6 billion Towns Fund. And for very high areas, we will give further financial support for local test and trace, and local enforcement and assistance from the armed forces – not for enforcement but rather to support local services, if desired in the local area. Mr Speaker, I can report that we have been able to reach agreement with leaders in Merseyside. Local Authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move into the “very high” alert level from Wednesday. In addition to the baseline I have outlined, that is as well as pubs and bars, in Merseyside gyms and leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will also close. I would like to put on record my thanks to Steve Rotheram and his colleagues for their cooperation in very difficult circumstances. Engagement with other leaders in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire & Humber is continuing. I know how difficult this is – they like, like everyone in the House, us are grappling with very real dilemmas - but we cannot let the NHS fall over when lives are at stake. So let me repeat the offer that we are making to those local authorities – work with us on these difficult but necessary measures in the areas that are rated very high areas, in return for: I believe not to act would be unforgivable, so I hope that rapid progress can be made in the coming days. Regulations for all three Covid local alert levels are being laid today. They will be debated and voted on tomorrow, before coming into force on Wednesday. We will also keep these measures under constant review, including a four-week sunset clause for interventions in “very high” areas. A postcode search on gov.uk, as well as the NHS Covid-19 app, will show which local alert level applies in each area and we are also publishing updated guidance to explain what the Covid alert levels mean for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And while these levels specifically apply to England, we continue work closely with the Devolved Administrations to tackle this virus across the whole of United Kingdom. Mr Speaker This is not how we want to live our lives, but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic With local and regional and national government coming together in a shared responsibility and a shared effort to deliver ever better testing and tracing, ever more efficient enforcement of the rules and with ever improving therapies, with the mountains of PPE and the ventilators that we have stockpiled With all the lessons we have learned in the last few months we are becoming better and better at fighting this virus and though I must warn the House again that the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed And I commend this statement to the House","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-12-october-2020"
"51","Prime Minister announces new local COVID Alert Levels",2020-10-12,"The Prime Minister has today set out how the government will further simplify and standardise local rules by introducing a three tiered system of local COVID Alert Levels in England. Addressing MPs before hosting a Downing Street press conference, he confirmed the levels will be set at medium, high, and very high. He set out how this new approach will be simpler and standardised, and thanked local leaders who have engaged with the government over the weekend. The “medium” alert level – which will cover most of the country – will consist of the current national measures, which came into force on 25 September. This includes the Rule of Six, and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. The “high” alert level will reflect many current local interventions, but there will now be consistency across the country. This primarily aims to reduce household to household transmission by preventing all mixing between households or support bubbles indoors. The Rule of Six will apply in outdoor spaces, including private gardens. Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into the “high” alert level. The “very high” alert level will apply where transmission rates are causing the greatest concern, based on an assessment of all the available data and the local situation. This includes incidence and test positivity, including amongst older and more at-risk age groups, as well as the growth rate, hospital admissions and other factors. In these areas, the government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens, with the Rule of Six allowed in open public spaces like parks and beaches. Pubs and bars must close, and can only remain open where they operate as if they were a restaurant – which means serving substantial meals, like a main lunchtime or evening meal. They may only serve alcohol as part of such a meal. People will be advised not to travel in and out of these areas. To create local consensus behind this more severe action, the government will work with local leaders on how individual areas should go beyond this baseline, which may include measures such as the closure of gyms, casinos, and leisure centres. Non-essential retail, schools and universities will remain open in all levels. Cases are rising rapidly across the country, particularly in the North East and North West, and this is resulting in increased hospitalisations and deaths. The Prime Minster said that further action is required now to suppress the virus and make sure the NHS isn’t overwhelmed, and can continue providing essential services such as cancer care. This follows significant local engagement throughout the weekend. On Sunday, the Prime Minister spoke to Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, following detailed discussions over the last few days between all the region’s leaders, Chief Executives and senior government figures. They discussed the huge challenge from rising numbers of COVID cases in the region and pledged to work together on combatting the virus. Senior No 10 advisers and the Housing Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick also held discussions with local authority leaders and mayors from the highest areas of concern. As the Prime Minister said, in recent months, local outbreaks have been tackled with targeted restrictions – helping save lives and avoiding the need to apply those measures nationally. However, over time this has led to different rules in different parts of the country, with some rules becoming increasingly complex and difficult to enforce. A postcode checker on GOV.UK shows which alert level applies in each area and the NHS COVID-19 app will also direct people to this information. Regulations for all three local alert levels will be laid today and they will be debated and voted on in the House of Commons tomorrow. Subject to that vote tomorrow, they will come into force on Wednesday, subject to the approval of Parliament. These measures will be kept under constant review, including a four-week sunset clause for interventions in “very high” areas. The PM also confirmed that the government will also provide Local Authorities across England with around £1 billion of new financial support. He also said that engagement with other leaders in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire & Humber is continuing. He also called on local leaders in the areas rated very high to work with the government on these measures, in return for more support for local test and trace, more funding for local enforcement, the offer of help from the armed services, and the job support scheme as announced by the Chancellor. Full details on what the COVID Alert Levels contain are set out below. This is for areas where national restrictions continue to be in place. This means: This is for areas with a very high level of infections. The Government will set a baseline of measures for any area in this local alert level. Consultation with local authorities will determine additional measures.

"52","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 October 2020",2020-10-12,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus on 12 October 2020 Good evening everyone. We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus. Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeks and it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable. There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdown and deaths, alas, are also rising once again. These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet. And we must act now. So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus. Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service. And so we can squash this virus wherever it appears we are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert. Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles. And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure. Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely. And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support. But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardens and pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal. We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas. Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves. And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks, and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement. You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live. The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium. Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High, and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level. Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying. And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level. In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close. We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas. But tackle it we will. No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty, but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virus and that, together, we will do just that. With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-october-2020"
"53","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 October 2020",2020-10-16,"Good afternoon, I am joined this afternoon by Dr Susan Hopkins of NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England and Sir Patrick Vallance Chief Scientific Advisor. On Monday, I explained that we would seek to consult with mayors and local authorities in areas moving into the Very High alert level. I am grateful to all those in local government in hotspot areas who have been working with us over the last week on how to control the virus in their areas. In particular, I would like to thank Steve Rotheram in Merseyside, Sadiq Khan in London and local leaders in Lancashire who have worked constructively with us. In Merseyside, where the situation is most acute, we were able to conclude talks quickly. In London, we have worked with the Mayor to respond to rising infections across the capital as well as particular spikes in some boroughs. And in Lancashire today, we have worked with both Labour and Conservative leaders to agree a package. These were tough discussions, difficult decisions. No one wants to have to implement these measures which damage local businesses, curtail individual freedom and impose significant strains on people’s mental health. But these decisions were necessary because of the rate of increase not just of infections but also in hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care. Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled in order to cope. And many more people would die. So taking action is the right and responsible thing to do. And it is backed up by significant support for areas on Very High alert: The Job Support Scheme, combined with Universal Credit, means that those on low incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of their wages. We are providing up to £465 million to help Very High alert level areas to implement and enforce the restrictions, in addition to the £1 billion of extra funding for local authorities across the country. We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing. Now, we have not yet reached an agreement with Greater Manchester. I completely understand the reluctance of the Mayor and his colleagues to take Manchester into the Very High alert level. It is far from a pain-free course of action and it will mean a difficult time for the people of that great part of the country – on top of the restrictions they have already had to endure since the summer. But I must stress, the situation in Greater Manchester is grave, and it worsens with each passing day. Cases doubled in the last 9 days. High infection rates are creeping up the age range: while cases are 690 per 100,000 for 16-29 year olds, they have now risen to 224 per 100,000 for the over-60s. The number of COVID in-patients in Manchester’s ICU beds is already over 40% of the number at the height of the first wave. That number will inevitably rise further, given that hospitalisation occurs 2-3 weeks after infection. On present trends, in just over 2 weeks there will be more Covid patients in intensive care than at the peak of the first wave. So I urge the Mayor to reconsider and engage constructively. I cannot stress enough – time is of the essence. Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care, and tragically more people will die. Of course if agreement cannot be reached, I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester’s hospitals and to save the lives of Manchester’s residents. But our efforts will be so much more effective if we work together. Some have argued that we should introduce a national lockdown instead of targeted local action and I disagree. Closing businesses in Cornwall, where transmission is low, will not cut transmission in Manchester. So while I cannot rule anything out, if at all possible I want to avoid another national lockdown, with the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have. Alongside our local strategy we have been working throughout to find other ways to suppress this virus. We are backing our brilliant scientists leading the global effort to find a safe and effective vaccine. We have also secured early access to over 350 million vaccine doses through a portfolio of promising new vaccines to ensure we are in the best place, and we are taking every possible step to ensure we can move as quickly as possible to deploy a vaccine if and when one is found to work. And we’ve created a huge diagnostics industry from scratch, scaling up the ability to test from 2,000 in February to more than 300,000 today. I also want to update on our future approach to testing. We are now testing more people than any other country in Europe but we always want to go further. One of the most dangerous aspects of this disease is that people without any symptoms can infect many others without realising it. If we can catch more asymptomatic people before they unknowingly pass on the disease to the vulnerable, we can help to stop the virus’ vicious spread. So far it has been difficult to do this. But that is changing. Scientists and companies in Britain and around the world have been developing new tests which are faster, simpler and cheaper. They have been working hard to discover and evaluate new testing technologies. Though there is work to do, It’s becoming clear over the past few weeks that some of these new tests are highly effective and can help us save lives and jobs over winter. We have already bought millions of these tests, some of which are very simple – meaning you simply need to wipe the swab inside your mouth – and can give a result as quickly as in 15 minutes. Some of these fast tests work with saliva and we are already using these in hospitals. We have started building the infrastructure for domestic manufacture of these tests, ensuring that Britain has the ability to produce millions of fast tests here. Over the next few weeks we will start distributing and trialling these tests across the country. This will enable us to do quick turnaround tests on NHS and care home staff much more frequently. By testing more frequently and quickly than ever before, we can hope we can help prevent the virus entering and spreading through care homes. And we will be able to test students in universities with outbreaks, as well as children in schools, helping us to keep education open safely through the winter. And we will make tests available to local directors of public health to help control localised outbreaks - handing more control from London to all parts of our country so that those on the ground can use the tools we give them as they think best. And I have instructed my team to ensure that Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, and any other areas which enter into the Very High alert level are immediately prioritised for those tests. This will make a big difference in how we protect people from this disease. But it’s vital that we all take a cautious approach to this new technology. First, it will take time to develop this plan. No country in the world is regularly testing millions of people, so we need to take the time to establish how to do this effectively and safely, and to build the logistics and distribution operation necessary for a large-scale operation across the country. Second, we won’t be able to use testing to get business back to normal quickly. In time, we want to use tests to open, and keep open, more parts of the economy that have sadly been closed. But it is crucial that we make sure such systems work safely and I must level with you that it will take time to get this right before many organisations can buy and operate these tests themselves. Third, this will need a huge effort across the country, and we will need hospitals, care homes schools, universities and other organisations to work with us as we develop this plan. But the most important thing is that people isolate if they test positive. If you test positive with one of these fast new tests, then you must stay at home. If everyone follows the rule and self-isolates if you have symptoms, get a positive test, or have come into contact with someone who has the virus, we will suppress the disease. And we must all remember that this virus thrives on human contact. So we must do everything in our power to limit its spread. Always think: Hands Face Space, ventilate your buildings, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, keep your distance from others. And make sure - as I say - you improve ventilation when spending time indoors. If we all do these simple things we’ll protect each other from the virus and we will defeat it together. I’ll hand over to Patrick Valance who will run through the latest data and we’ll then go to your questions. Sir Patrick.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-october-2020"
"54","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 October 2020",2020-10-20,"PM statement at the coronavirus press conference on 20 October Good afternoon, Across the world, the countries most successful in their fight against coronavirus are adopting regional and local measures to protect their populations. That is why last week we launched the three Local COVID Alert Levels for England, with interventions based on the prevalence of the virus in local areas. Since then we have been undertaking discussions with local leaders in those parts of the country which are currently bearing the brunt of the second wave of this epidemic. Before I update you on those discussions, I will ask Jonathan Van-Tam to brief us on the latest data nationally and in Greater Manchester. Thank you very much JVT. That presentation you’ve just seen shows you clearly why we must act. Now I don’t want anyone to think their actions or efforts have been in vain. Our collective action, across the country, has brought the R number well below its natural rate of about 3. As a result, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March. However, while the R is below its natural level, it does remain above 1, meaning the virus continues to spread. So, we need to take action to reduce the R and control the virus, especially in those parts of the country, as you’ve just seen, where the virus is most prevalent. This evening, informed by the data we have just seen, I can announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High alert level. This means that: In line with the additional measures taken in Lancashire, casinos, bingo halls, betting shops, adult gaming centres and soft play areas must also close. Regulations will be laid in Parliament on Thursday and come into force just after midnight. I know that these restrictions are tough, both on businesses and individuals. And believe me no one wants to be putting these things into effect. But that is why we are putting in place a comprehensive package of support: Over the last 10 days, we have sought to agree an approach with local leaders in Greater Manchester. Unfortunately, agreement wasn’t been reached. And I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together. In addition I must say, to the support outlined above, we made a generous and extensive offer to support Manchester’s businesses. This offer was proportionate to the support we have given Merseyside and Lancashire, but the Mayor didn’t accept this unfortunately. And given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level. Because not to act would put Manchester’s NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester’s residents, at risk. Despite the failure to reach an agreement, I hope the Mayor and council leaders in Greater Manchester will now work with us to implement these measures. Elsewhere, discussions on moving to the Very High alert level continue with local leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East. I hope and expect central and local government will continue to work closely together, as we are seeing in Merseyside, Lancashire, London and many other parts of the country. Because – ultimately – all of us want to protect the NHS, and in doing so to save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-october-2020"
"55","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 October 2020",2020-10-22,"PM statement on coronavirus 22 October I am very glad to be joined today not just by Sir Patrick Vallance but by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak who is going to tell us more in a moment about our latest package to help this country in its battle with Covid. And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward. I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses. We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths. And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that. And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs. So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach. And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May. And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost. Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead. And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country. So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach. A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus. A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus. And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country. I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness. And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working. Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate. And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down. And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country –  support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business. And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others. And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown. We will win this fight against Covid. Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better. And we have shown before that we can drive the R down. And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery. I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-october-2020"

First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data. Data Presentation Thank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures. When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do. Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health. No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere. We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere. Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country. And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities. Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying off And we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead But as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of nature And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisers Whose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day A peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in April Even in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act. And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of life Because the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat Who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t Who would live and who would die, And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patients And the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they need It is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under control And if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families And even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacity And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative. From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home. You may only leave home for specific reasons, including: For education;
For work, say if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm;
To shop for food and essentials;
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up. Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others. I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home. I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that. This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December. There will be some differences compared to March. These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together. My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be. We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open. And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going. So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you. On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action. So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way ahead Because people will reasonably ask when will this all end And as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests Tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes And we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests Applying them in an ever-growing number of situations From helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole cities The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days Working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread And I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term future We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April It is less prohibitive and less restrictive But from Thursday the basic message is the same Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-october-2020"
"57","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 2 November",2020-11-02,"Mr Speaker with your permission, I will make a statement on the measures we must now take to contain the autumn surge of Coronavirus, protect our NHS and save lives. On Saturday evening the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser described the remorseless advance of this second wave. The extraordinary efforts being made by millions of people across the country especially by those in very high alert areas have made a real difference, suppressing the R rate below where it would otherwise have been. But the R is still above one in every part of England as it is across much of Europe and the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario. There are already more Covid patients in some hospitals now than at the height of the first wave, 2,000 more this Sunday than last Sunday. While the prevalence of the virus is worse in parts of the North, the doubling time in the South East and the Midlands is now faster than in the North West. Even in the South West, where incidence remains low, current projections mean they will start to run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks. And the modelling presented by our scientists suggests that without action, we could see up to twice as many deaths over the winter as we saw in the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level. I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. And I reject any idea that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners. In fact, we are moving to national measures when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were in France. We are engaged in a constant struggle to protect lives and livelihoods, and we must balance the restrictions we introduce against the long term scars they leave, whether for businesses and jobs, or our physical and mental health. No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential, so it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions, sometimes for months on end. I want to thank them, and to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. And we will continue as far as possible to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead. But we are fighting a disease Mr Speaker, and when the data changes course, we must change course too. To those in this House who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face. If we allow our health system to be overwhelmed – exactly as the data now suggests – then that would not only be a disaster for thousands of Covid patients, because their survival rates would fall, we would also reach a point where the NHS was no longer there for everyone. The sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals. That sacred principle - of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – could be broken for the first time in our lives. Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die. And this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, but from not focusing enough. If we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would deprive others of the care they need. Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures: all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control. And even though we are so much better prepared than before, with stockpiles of PPE and ventilators, the Nightingales on standby, and 13,000 more nurses than last year, I am afraid the virus is doubling faster than we could ever conceivably add capacity. Even if we doubled capacity, the gain would be consumed in a single doubling of the virus. And so on Wednesday the House will vote on regulations which, if passed, will mean that from Thursday until 2nd December, in England, people will only be permitted to leave home for specific reasons, including: Essential shops will remain open and click and collect services will continue, so people do not need to stock up. But I am afraid that non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues and the personal care sector will all be closed. Hospitality must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Places of worship can open for individual prayer, funerals and formal childcare but sadly not for services. However Remembrance Sunday events can go ahead, provided they are held outside, and observe social distancing. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in construction or manufacturing. Elite sport will also be able to continue. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. The clinically vulnerable and those over 60 should minimise their contact with others. And while we will not ask people to shield again in the same way, the clinically extremely vulnerable should only work from home. Mr Speaker, I am truly sorry for the anguish these measures will impose, particularly for businesses which had just got back on their feet, businesses across the country who have gone to such trouble to make themselves Covid secure, to install Perspex screens, to do the right thing. Each of these actions has helped to bring the R down, and their hard work and your hard work will stand them in good stead, but for now it is clear that we must do more together. So the government will continue to do everything possible to support jobs and livelihoods in the next four weeks as we have throughout. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13.7 billion to help the self-employed, and I can announce today that for November we will double our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will also extend the deadline for applications to Covid loan schemes from the end of this month to the end of next to ensure that small businesses can access additional loans if required. We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April, and there are ways in which these measures are less prohibitive. We have for instance a moral duty to keep schools open now that it is safe to do so, because we must not allow this virus to damage our children’s futures. So schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings - and I am pleased this will command support Mr Speaker across the House. It is also vital that we continue provision for non-Covid healthcare so people should turn up to use the NHS, to get their scans, turn up for appointments and collect their treatments. Mr Speaker let me stress that these restrictions are time limited. After four weeks, on Wednesday 2nd December, they will expire and we intend to return to a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends, and the House will have a vote to agree the way forward. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and will continue to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. And while scientists are bleak in their predictions over the short-term, they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and long-term. And if the House asks me Mr Speaker what is the exit strategy, what is the way out – let me be as clear as I can: it is to get the R down now – to beat this autumn surge and to use this moment to exploit the medical and technical advances we are making to keep it low. We now have not only much better medication and the prospect of a vaccine the immediate prospect of many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests – with a result in minutes. Trials have already shown that we can help suppress the disease in hospitals, schools and universities by testing large numbers of NHS workers, children, teachers and students. These tests, crucially, identify people who are infectious but do not have symptoms, allowing them immediately to self-isolate and stop the spread of the disease, and allowing those who are not infectious to continue as normal. This means that, unlike in the spring, it’s possible to keep these institutions open and still stop the spread of the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests which we will be manufacturing in this country applying them in an ever-growing number of situations, from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even cities. The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days. Mr Speaker, we have dexamethasone – the first validated life-saving treatment for the disease, pioneered in this country. We have the real prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year and we have ever more sophisticated means of providing virtually instant tests. I believe that these technical developments, taken together, will enable us to defeat this virus by the spring, as humanity has defeated every other infectious disease. And I am not alone in this optimism but I cannot pretend that the way ahead is easy, or without painful choices for us all. And so for the next four weeks I must ask the people of this country to come together, to protect the NHS, and to save many thousands of lives. And Mr Speaker I commend this statement to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-2-november"
"58","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus: 4 November 2020",2020-11-04,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations are approved and that we come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from midnight, so we can contain the Autumn surge of the virus,
protect our NHS and save many lives. Of course, this not something that any of us wanted to do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, To furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family. And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead. But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first; and when I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered alas to work on covid wards,
and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make space, I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people. And I know, Mr Speaker, it might be tempting to think that because some progress has been made we just need to stay the course and see through our locally led approach. And it is true that the extraordinary efforts of millions across the country especially those in high and very high alert level areas – they have made a difference, Mr Speaker suppressing the R, the reproduction rate of the virus below where it would have otherwise have been And I want to record again my thanks again to the millions who have put up with local restrictions, and I want to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. But I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave. Even in the South West, which has so far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions are over half way to their first wave peak. SAGE’s latest analysis, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains above 1 in every part of England,
which means the virus is continuing to grow among the population. And every day that the number is above one, is another day that the number of cases will rise locking in, more hospital admissions and alas more fatalities. and pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope. The course we have before us is to prevent the R from going back remaining above one and to get it down. Otherwise we face a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached. And I know there has been some debate about the projections from some of these models, for example, exactly how big the loss of life might be, or the precise point at which the NHS might be overwhelmed, but all the scientific experts that I have talked to are unanimous on one point As the Chief Medical Officer has said –
“if we did not act now, then the chance of the NHS being in extraordinary trouble in December would be very, very high.” And be in no doubt Mr Speaker what that means for our country and for our society. It means that the precious principle - of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – that principal could be shattered for the first time in our experience It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help - could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals Mr Speaker even in East Sussex Mr Speaker. Doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who couldn’t. And I know that there are some Members like my honourable friend who are hearing from their local hospitals that the pressure is not that great yet. But the whole point about a National Health Service, is that when hospitals in one part of the country are over-run,
sick patients are transferred to another, until the whole system falls over. And let me be clear this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted but from not focusing enough. Because if we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would not only lead to the covid casualties that I’ve described but which would deprive other patients of the care they need. We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone. And Mr Speaker this fate is not inevitable. We are moving to these national measures here when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were for instance in France, when President Macron took similar steps. If we act now and act decisively we can stem the rising waters before our defences are breached. And this approach, these regulations I do believe are the way we can do that. Mr Speaker, I know there are many in the House who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that we are trapped with these national measures for months on end. So let me level with the House. Of course, I cannot say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2nd December, But what I can say is that the national measures – that I hope the House will vote on tonight - are time-limited. It is not that we choose to stop them. They legally expire. So whatever we decide to do from 2nd December will require a fresh mandate and a fresh vote from this House. And as I have made clear, it is my express intent that we should return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Mr Speaker, the whole House will share my sorrow and regret at the necessity of these measures,
particularly for businesses who had just got back on their feet Mr Speaker, who had done their level best to make themselves Covid-secure,
installing handwashing stations, plexiglass screens, one-way systems And as the Chancellor has set out, we will do whatever it takes to support them. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13 billion to help support the self-employed, and we are now doubling our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits for the self-employed for this month. We’re providing cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses who are closed - worth over £1 billion a month and benefiting over 600,000 business premises. We are giving funding of £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England, to further support businesses and their local economy in the winter months. And this comes on top of the more than £200 billion we’ve provided since March. And we will also ensure that throughout this period that our schools stay open. We will not allow this virus to do any further damage to the future of our children. I said in the Summer we had a moral duty to reopen our schools as soon as it was safe to do so and that they would be the last element of society to close down again. And we have stuck to that pledge Mr Speaker Our schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings. Mr Speaker, the measures before the House are designed to arrest the virus, to drive it down and to get on top of it once and for all. If we are able to test on a big enough scale to identify the people who are infected – often without symptoms and who unwittingly, asymptomatically pass the virus to others then those people will be helped immediately – this is the key thing - to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission, and reducing the spread of the virus –reducing the number of people in hospital, reducing the number of people dying. I think that if we all play our part in this system it could be a hugely valuable weapon in our fight against Covid in the short medium and long term, and an alternative to the blanket restrictions that have been imposed in so many parts of the world. We are piloting this week a mass test in Liverpool, where an immense effort benefiting from the logistical skill of the armed services will offer everyone a test. And our aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country. Thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists, we already have a life-saving treatment for Covid and the genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year. Taken together, these achievements provide every reason for confidence that our country can and will pull through this crisis and that our ingenuity will prove equal to the challenge. Mr Speaker, this year I and the whole government has asked much of the British people. More than any Prime Minister I believe has asked of the British people in peacetime. And I have to say that the public have responded magnificently and selflessly. Putting their lives on hold, bearing any burden, overcoming every obstacle and tolerating every disruption and inconvenience no matter how large or small or inconsistent Mr Speaker so that they can do the right thing by their fellow citizens. I wish that it had been enough to defeat this Autumn surge. But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute. It is absolutely right for this House – for members on all sides of this House- to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me and to provide scrutiny. That is the purpose and duty of the House of Commons. But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy. So now is the time for us to put our differences aside and focus on the next four weeks, getting this virus back to its box. And I know that, once again, our amazing country will respond to adversity by doing what is right – staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving lives. And in that spirit, I commend these regulations to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-4-november-2020"
"59","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 November 2020",2020-11-05,"PM statement on coronavirus 5 November 2020 Good evening everyone, Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box.
Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people. We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK. We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK. Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live. The challenges we face are significant across the U.K. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier. There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK. In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home. As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies. The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do. I know how tough this is: For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline. For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to. For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet. I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures though they are tough are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists. Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool. I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus. More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead. And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions. As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March. We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits. We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month. We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses. And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need. As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation. Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter. These are difficult times. And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this. So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-november-2020"
"60","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 November 2020",2020-11-09,"PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020 Across the country and around the world this evening, people are asking one question about our fight against Covid, does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles? So, let me set out our assessment. The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus. But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data, and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed. So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used. What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it. Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each. That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well. If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution. We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can. And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course. But – and you know I am going to say this - I must stress, these are very, very early days. We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution. The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment. On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions. Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago The number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak. Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or not we must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down. And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help. Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council. We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come. The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpool so do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community. And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council. And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations. We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country. But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy. And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest. So it is all the more important to follow the rules. I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictions and I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach. Remember the basics, hands, face, space, and the follow the rules, that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box. And that is what we will do. So thank you. And I’m now going to hand over to Brigadier Fossey to talk about how the unrivalled logistical expertise of the British army that’s helping to deliver mass testing to Liverpool.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-november-2020"
"61","PM statement on COVID-19 Winter Plan: 23 November 2020",2020-11-23,"Mr Speaker, thank you very much and with your permission, I will make a statement on the Government’s COVID-19 Winter Plan. For the first time since this wretched virus took hold, we can see a route out of the pandemic. The breakthroughs in treatment, in testing and vaccines mean that the scientific cavalry is now in sight and we know in our hearts that next year we will succeed. By the Spring, these advances should reduce the need for the restrictions we have endured in 2020 and make the whole concept of a Covid lockdown redundant. When that moment comes, it will have been made possible by the sacrifices of millions of people across the United Kingdom. I am acutely conscious that no other peacetime Prime Minister has asked so much of the British people and just as our country has risen to every previous trial, so it has responded this time, and I am deeply grateful. But the hard truth, Mr Speaker, is that we are not there yet. First we must get through Winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains, at exactly the time when the burden on the NHS is always greatest. Our Winter Plan is designed to carry us safely to Spring. In recent weeks, families and businesses in England have, once again, steadfastly observed nationwide restrictions and they have managed to slow the growth of new cases and ease the worst pressures on our NHS. I can therefore confirm that national restrictions in England will end on 2nd December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces, subject to the Rule of Six. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a Winter or New Year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas, so we are not going to replace national measures with a free for all, the status quo ante Covid. We are going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. And while the previous local tiers did cut the R number, they were not quite enough to reduce it below 1, so the scientific advice, I am afraid, is that as we come out is that our tiers need to be made tougher. In particular, in tier 1 people should work from home wherever possible. In tier 2, alcohol may only be served in hospitality settings as part of a substantial meal. In tier 3, indoor entertainment, hotels and other accommodation will have to close, along with all forms of hospitality, except for delivery and takeaways. And I am very sorry obviously for the unavoidable hardship that this will cause to business owners who have already endured so much disruption this year. Mr Speaker, unlike the previous arrangements, tiers will now be a uniform set of rules, That’s to say we won’t have negotiations on additional measures with each region, it’s a uniform set of rules We have learnt from experience that there are some things we can do differently So from the 10pm closing time for hospitality we’re going to change that to so that it is last orders at 10 with closing at 11. In tiers 1 and 2, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside - with capacity limits and social distancing – providing more consistency with indoor performances in theatres and concert halls. We will also strengthen the enforcement ability of Local Authorities, including specially trained officers and new powers to close down premises that pose a risk to public health. Later this week we will announce which areas will fall into which tier, I hope on Thursday, based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over 60s, also looking at the rate by which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid, and the current and projected pressures on the NHS.
   I am sorry to say we expect that more regions will fall – at least temporarily – into higher levels than before, but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below 1 and keep it there, it should be possible for areas to move down the tiering scale to lower levels of restrictions. By maintaining the pressure on the virus, we can also enable people to see more of their family and friends over Christmas. Mr Speaker, I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas, we need it, we certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. So to allow families to come together, while minimising the risk, we are working with the Devolved Administrations on a special, time-limited Christmas dispensation, embracing the whole of the United Kingdom, and reflecting the ties of kinship across our islands. But this virus is obviously not going to grant us a Christmas truce, it doesn’t know it’s Christmas Mr Speaker and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risk of visiting elderly relatives. We will be publishing guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable on how to manage the risks in each tier, as well as over Christmas. As we work to suppress the virus with these local tiers, two scientific breakthroughs will ultimately make these restrictions obsolete. As soon as a vaccine is approved, we will dispense it as quickly as possible. But given that this cannot be done immediately, we will simultaneously use rapid turnaround testing, the lateral flow testing that gives results within 30 minutes, to identify those without symptoms so they can isolate and avoid transmission. We are beginning to deploy these tests in our NHS and in care homes in England, so people will once again be able to hug and hold hands with loved ones, instead of waving at them through a window. By the end of the year, this will allow every care home resident to have two visitors, who can be tested twice a week. Care workers looking after people in their own homes will be offered weekly tests from today. And from next month, weekly tests will also be available to staff in prisons, food manufacturing, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines. We are also using testing as the House knows to help schools and universities stay open, and testing will enable students to know they can go home safely for Christmas and indeed back from home to university. But there is another way of using these rapid tests, and that is to follow the example of Liverpool, where in the last two and a half weeks over 200,000 people have taken part in community testing, contributing to a very substantial fall in infections. So together with NHS Test and Trace and our fantastic Armed Forces, we will now launch a major community testing programme, offering all local authorities in tier 3 areas in England a six week surge of testing. The system is untried and there are of course many unknowns, but if it works, we should be able to offer those who test negative the prospect of fewer restrictions, for example, meeting up in certain places with others who have also tested negative. And those towns and regions which engage in community testing will have a much greater chance of easing the rules, the tiering, that they currently endure. Mr Speaker, we will also use daily testing to ease another restriction that has impinged on many lives. We will seek to end automatic isolation for close contacts of those found positive. Beginning in Liverpool later this week, contacts who are tested every day for a week will only need to isolate if they themselves test positive. If successful, this approach will be extended across the health system next month, and to the whole of England from January. And, of course, we are working with the Devolved Administrations to ensure that Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland also benefit as they should and will from these advances in rapid testing. But clearly the most hopeful advance of all is how vaccines are now edging ever closer to liberating us from the virus, demonstrating emphatically that this is not a pandemic without end. We can take heart from today’s news, which has the makings of a wonderful British scientific achievement. The vaccine developed with astonishing speed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is now one of three capable of delivering a period of immunity.
 
   We don’t yet know when any will be ready and licensed,
 
    but we have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine,
 
    and over 350 million in total,
 
more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories. And the NHS is preparing a nationwide immunisation programme, ready next month, the like of which we have never witnessed. Mr Speaker, 2020 has been in many ways a tragic year when so many have lost loved ones and faced financial ruin. This will be still a hard Winter, Christmas cannot be normal, and there is a long road to Spring. But we have turned a corner: and the escape route is in sight. We must hold out against the virus until testing and vaccines come to our rescue and reduce the need for restrictions. Everyone can help speed up the arrival of that moment by continuing to follow the rules, getting tested and self-isolating when instructed, remembering hands, face and space, and pulling together for one final push to the Spring, when we have every reason to hope and believe that the achievements of our scientists will finally lift the shadow of the virus. Mr Speaker, I commend this Statement to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-covid-19-winter-plan-23-november-2020"
"62","Prime Minister publishes COVID Winter Plan",2020-11-23,"The Prime Minister has published the government’s COVID Winter Plan, setting out the end of national restrictions and the steps ministers will take to help bring life back to normal by Spring. The plan seeks to bring R below 1, find new ways of managing the virus and enabling life to return closer to normal, and minimise damage to the economy and society. The collective effort during national restrictions has brought the virus back under control, slowed its spread and eased pressure on the NHS – meaning national restrictions will end on 2 December. Across England, this means the ‘stay at home’ order will end and shops, gyms, personal care, and the leisure sector will reopen. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and people will not be limited to seeing one other person in outdoor public spaces. Instead, the rule of 6 will again apply. However, the virus is still present and the Prime Minster, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Advisor agree that without targeted measures in areas where it is most prevalent, it could again run out of control. That would jeopardise progress made, and risk intolerable pressure on the NHS. England will therefore move back into a regional, tiered approach – safeguarding the gains made, and using scientific advances in vaccination, treatments and testing to enable life gradually to return closer to normal by Spring. Some restrictions will be amended, given lessons learned from previous tiers. For example, the hospitality curfew has been modified to last orders at 10pm and closing time at 11pm, allowing customers to depart in a staggered way. In tiers 1 and 2, spectator sport can also resume outside with capacity limits and social distancing, providing consistency with theatres and concert halls. But SAGE are clear that, while previous tiers reduced the R rate, they were not enough to bring it below 1. That is why all tiers will be toughened. For example, in tier 1 people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. In tier 2, alcohol may only be served in hospitality settings as part of a substantial meal. In tier 3, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close. These tiers will be uniform, without negotiations on specific measures, and will be based on the following criteria: Tiering allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and tiering regulations will expire in law at the end of March. Ministers continue to work with the Devolved Administrations on plans for temporary relaxation over Christmas and will set out details shortly, including for the clinically extremely vulnerable. Given how tough these measures are for tier 3 areas, the government will rapidly extend community testing in those areas. Following the example of Liverpool, tier 3 areas will be able to participate in a six-week community testing programme to identify asymptomatic cases, and ensure they self-isolate. The government also plans to introduce frequent testing as an alternative to the need for self-isolation for people who have had close contact with a positive case. Instead, contacts would have regular tests during the isolation period and only have to self-isolate if they test positive. This will be trialled in Liverpool first then, if successful, will be rolled out across the NHS and care homes in December, and to everyone else from early next year. We will set out full details of our plans shortly. You can read the full COVID Winter Plan here.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-publishes-covid-winter-plan"

"64","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020",2020-11-26,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020 We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions. But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus. The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases. As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue. Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed, but those dangers have not gone away. If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean. The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome. All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation. In Italy there is a nightly curfew, in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December, and in France, until 20 January. Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus. Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and the pressure on the NHS. We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area. To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available. I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures. I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector, our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities - which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited. What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures. In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen. You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can. The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again. But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that. While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions. And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve. While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus, they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there, so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in. Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1, opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves. And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing, allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolate thereby reducing the R. And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it. The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing. Liverpool shows what can be achieved. In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conducted and together with the effect of national restrictions, this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds. So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2. This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate so we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces, to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible, opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example. Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions even if their home area stays in tier 3. The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December. So your tier is not your destiny. Every area has the means of escape. And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter, suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid, and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-november-2020"
"65","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus regulations: 1 December 2020",2020-12-01,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations now be approved. And I want to begin by telling the House that I was hugely encouraged by a visit I paid only yesterday to a vaccine plant in North Wales where I saw for myself the vials of one of seven vaccines backed by the UK Government that could turn the tide of our struggle against Covid, not just in this country but around the world. It is the protection of those vaccines that could get our economies moving again, and allow us to reclaim our lives. And that one plant in Wrexham could produce 300 million doses a year and yesterday was the momentous day when it began to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And it was a very moving moment Mr Speaker when I talked to one of the brilliant young scientists there, And she described the extraordinary moment for her in her life, to be part of an enterprise that was she thought truly going to offer humanity a route out of this suffering. But Mr Speaker, we have to be realistic, And we have to accept that this vaccine is not here yet, no vaccine is here yet and while all the signs are promising and almost every scientist I’ve talked to agrees that the breakthrough will surely come we do not yet have one that has gained regulatory approval. We can’t be completely sure when the moment will arrive and until then we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter. The national measures which are now shortly ending in England have eased the burden on the NHS and begun to reverse the advance of the virus. Today, the R is back below 1 and the ONS survey is showing that signs of the infection rate are levelling off and Imperial College London has found that the number of people with Covid has fallen by a third in England since 2nd November. But while the virus has been contained, it has not been eradicated. The latest ONS figures suggest that out of every 85 people in England, one has Coronavirus; far more than in the Summer between 24th November and yesterday, 3,222 people across the UK lost their lives; and despite the immense progress of the last four weeks, our NHS remains under pressure, with hospitals in three regions – the South West, the North East and Yorkshire - all treating more Covid patients now than at the peak of the first wave. So we can’t simply allow the current restrictions to expire for the reason he gives with no replacement whatever. With the spread of the epidemic varying across the country, there remains a compelling case for regional tiers in England and indeed Mr Speaker a compelling necessity for regional tiers. But I hope the House is clear what I am not asking for today. This is not another lockdown, nor is this the renewal of the existing measures in England. The tiers that I am proposing would mean that from tomorrow everyone in England – including those in tier 3 – will be free to leave their homes for any reason. And when they do, they will find the shops open for Christmas, the hairdressers open, the nail bars open, gyms and leisure centres, swimming pools open, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples will be open for communal worship. Organised outdoor sport will resume, and in every tier you will be able to meet others in parks and in public gardens subject to the Rule of Six. And every one of those things has been by necessity restricted until today. Every one of them would be allowed again tomorrow. Of course I accept that this is not a return to normality. I wish it were so. But it is a bit closer to normality than the present restrictions. And what we cannot do is lift all of the restrictions at once, or move too quickly, in such a way that the virus would begin to spread rapidly again. That would be the surest way of endangering our NHS and forcing us into a new year lockdown, with all the costs that that would impose. We all accept that the burden on the hospitality sector has been very great. We feel this deeply, because our pubs, our hotels, restaurants they are in many ways the heart of the communities And part of the fabric of our identity as a country And everybody can see that the hospitality industry has borne a disproportionate share of the burden in this crisis. There’s no question about it. And that is obviously because we want to keep schools open Mr Speaker and we have to take such measures as we can. I would just remind the House however, that we are not alone in this. In France bars, restaurants and gyms will not reopen until 20th January at the earliest. In Germany, the hospitality sector will remain closed in its entirety over Christmas. But we will do everything in our power to support our hospitality sector throughout this crisis. We have already extended the furlough scheme for all businesses until the end of March, We’ve provided monthly grants of up to £3,000 for premises forced to close, and £2,100 for those that remain open but have suffered because of reduced demand. We have allocated £1.1 billion for local authorities to support businesses at particular risk. And today Mr Speaker we are going further with a one-off payment of £1,000 in December to wet pubs – that is Mr Speaker pubs that do not serve food as the House knows recognising how hard they have been hit by this virus in what is typically their busiest month. We will also work with the hospitality sector in supporting their bounce back next year. Mr Speaker I want to stress, that the situation is profoundly different now because there is an end in sight. And I am not this afternoon seeking open-ended measures. On the contrary, these regulations come with a sunset clause at the end of February, sorry at the end of the 2 February I should say Mr Speaker. At that point we will have sufficient data to assess our position after Christmas, and though I believe these types of restrictions will be needed until the Spring, they can only be extended beyond 2 February if this House votes for them Mr Speaker. These are points that have been made with great power as I say by Hon Members on all sides of the House. We will review the allocation of tiers every fourteen days, starting on 16th December. I just want to make an important point to my Rt Hon friend and to all members who are rightly concerned about the position of their constituencies, our constituencies, in these tiers. Hon Members have it in their powers, in our power to help move our areas down the tiers, by throwing their full weight Mr Speaker, our full weight as leaders in our communities behind community testing, and seizing the opportunity, seizing the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to take part. Of the kind we’ve seen in Liverpool Mr Speaker where since the 6th November over 284,000 tests have been conducted, and together with the effect of national restrictions, the number of cases fell by more than two thirds. This is the model that I would recommend. We are now proposing that from tomorrow Liverpool City Region and Warrington should be in tier 2, where as previously obviously they were in tier 3. And we want other regions and other towns, cities, communities to follow this path, And that is why – with the help of our fantastic armed forces – we will be offering community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible. Mr Speaker let me just say, I find it extraordinary that the Official Opposition –represented by the gentleman opposite - Currently have no view on the way ahead and are not proposing to vote tonight. I do think it is extraordinary that in spite of the barrage of criticism that we have no credible plan from the party opposite. Indeed, we have no view on the way ahead. It’s a quite extraordinary thing Mr Speaker that tonight to the best of my knowledge The RHG Opposite who has always said he will ‘act in the national interest’ has told his party to sit on its hands and to abstain in the vote tonight Mr Speaker. And I think the government has made its decision, we’ve taken some tough decisions Mr Speaker and the Labour opposition has decided tonight heroically to abstain Mr Speaker And I think when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, I think the people of this country will observe that instead of having politicians of all parties coming together in the national interest they had one party taking the decisions and another party heroically deciding to abstain Mr Speaker, in the story of 2020, I think there are two great feats in which we can take a great deal of comfort. First, our country has come together in an extraordinary effort that has so far succeeded in protecting our NHS and in saving many lives. And while our scientists have been zeroing in on the weaknesses of Covid, telescoping ten years of work into ten months, and now their endeavours are about to deliver the means as I say to rout the virus. That is clear. The Government is backing not one potential vaccine, but seven. We have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that is now seeking regulatory approval. We have ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which has almost 95 per cent effectiveness in trials. And Mr Speaker, we have ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which if approved by the regulator – could start being administered before Christmas. In total, Mr Speaker our Vaccines Task Force has secured more than 350 million doses, more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and our Overseas Territories. All we need to do now Mr Speaker is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp, and indeed being injected into our arms. So I say to the House again let us follow the guidance, let us roll out mass testing, let’s work to deliver mass testing to the people of our country, let’s work together to control the virus and it is in that spirit that I commend these regulations Mr Speaker I commend these regulations to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-regulations-1-december-2020"
"66","Prime Minister announces £1,000 Christmas grant for 'wet-led pubs'",2020-12-01,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has today (Tuesday 1 December) announced an additional £1,000 Christmas grant for ‘wet-led pubs’ in tiers 2 and 3 who will miss out on much needed business during the busy Christmas period. Pubs that predominantly serve alcohol rather than provide food have been asked to make huge sacrifices over the festive season and will be eligible for a one-off £1000 to help make ends meet. The payment will be a one-off for December and will be paid on top on the existing £3,000 monthly cash grants for businesses. This will cover those in tiers 2 and 3 forced to reduce their operations as a result of the latest regional measures put in place to contain transmission of the virus. The move bolsters the government’s support for the pubs sector, following the extension of the furlough scheme and the business rates holiday which were extended until March 2021. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: Pubs are at the heart of communities across the country and they have been among the businesses which have suffered the most during the pandemic. While we can’t make up for all the trade they will lose over Christmas, I hope this new £1000 grant – on top of the furlough, VAT and  business rates relief and existing grants, goes some way to help them weather the economic storm. As the government prepares to introduce community testing across tier 3 areas and work on vaccines continues to progress, it is vital that we continue to bear down on the virus transmission rate to protect lives and livelihoods and ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed during the winter. Wet-led pubs in tiers 2 and 3 will be subject to significant measures under the new regional tiered system and it is right for the government to increase its support. Eligible wet-led pubs across these tiers are invited to apply through their local authority who will be responsible for distributing the grants. The payment will be made once per business for the month of December only. The additional support comes on top of £1.1 billion which is being given to local authorities, distributed on the basis of £20 per head, for one-off payments to enable them to support businesses more broadly. The government has also provided £10 billion business rates holiday for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses lasting until March, as well as £11.7 billion of initial grants of up to £25,000 at the start of the outbreak.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-1000-christmas-grant-for-wet-led-pubs"
"67","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 2 December 2020",2020-12-02,"PM statement on coronavirus 2 December It is almost a year since humanity has been tormented by COVID Across the world, economic output has plummeted and a million and a half people have died And all the time we have waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy And give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it And they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine from an idea that was pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner in 1796 And today we can announce that the government has accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution across the United Kingdom. after months of clinical trials, involving thousands of people to ensure that the vaccine meets the strictest, internationally recognised, standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force, we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates, and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine securing 40 million doses. Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK. And that is going to begin next week, and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, But there are immense logistical challenges: the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart. So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected, Long and cold months So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan, a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable, keep education and the economy going and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring. Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so; but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down. And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love. So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live, remember hands, face, space – and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing. Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions, as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden. And as we do all this, we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed: and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-december-2020"
"68","Government's Vaccines Taskforce has worked ""decisively"" and at ""great pace"" to improve UK's pandemic preparedness",2020-12-08,"The government has today (Tuesday 8 December) published a report highlighting the work and achievements of its Vaccines Taskforce (VTF), 6 months after it was set up to help in the fight against COVID-19. The independent review by Sir Richard Sykes, chair of the Royal Institution and former chair Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, found the VTF acted decisively and at great pace in the face of the pandemic, to secure access to 357 million doses of the most promising COVID-19 vaccines for the UK. The report found the successes of the VTF have been achieved through the expertise of its members, who operated with agility to put the UK ahead at the forefront of global efforts to tackle COVID-19. Key successes include the creation of the world’s first citizen registry of over 360,000 volunteers able to rapidly join vaccine trials, the pioneering of human challenge studies to accelerate future vaccine development and strategic investment to enhance the UK’s vaccine research and manufacturing infrastructure, including flexible manufacturing capability at sites at Harwell, Braintree and Livingston. Marking the publication of a report into work of the Vaccines Taskforce in the 6 months since it was set up, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: The approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use in the UK marks a momentous step in our fight against COVID-19. I am hugely grateful for the hard work and dedication of the Vaccine Taskforce, under Kate Bingham’s leadership, which has brought us to this point in challenging circumstances, representing the best the government and civil service can do – working with businesses, experts and the public to tackle a common problem at incredible pace. The country owes them a debt of gratitude. But we still have some way to go and everyone needs to keep following the rules to keep the virus under control. The VTF was established in April 2020 by the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, to drive forward, expedite and co-ordinate efforts to ensure the UK population would have access to a clinically safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19. Kate Bingham was appointed in May 2020 as Chair of the VTF, reporting directly to the Prime Minister and working under the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). In addition to securing access to vaccines, the VTF set out to establish a long-term vaccine strategy to prepare the UK for future pandemics and work with partners to support equitable access to vaccines for people worldwide, whether rich or poor. Business Secretary, Alok Sharma said: Our Vaccine Taskforce has undoubtedly risen to the challenge to build a diverse portfolio of promising vaccine candidates to give the UK the greatest chance of finding one that works. Thanks to Kate Bingham and her team, we were the first country to sign a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech, have secured more doses per head of population than almost any other country, and built a vaccine manufacturing base from scratch to strengthen our resilience to respond to COVID-19 and to future pandemics. The Taskforce’s impressive record has only been possible by bringing together business, science, industry expertise and the civil service to ensure the British public get access to a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. Our country owes every single person involved in this national effort a huge debt of gratitude. The outgoing chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, Kate Bingham said: Thanks to the mandate we were given by the Prime Minister, the Taskforce was able to rapidly strike deals for promising vaccines. Our aim was to ensure that the search for COVID-19 vaccines yielded positive results for the UK and the world. In doing so, we have cemented the UK’s global leadership in vaccine research, established much stronger manufacturing capability and clinical development capacity, ensuring we are much better prepared if, and when future pandemics arise. I am delighted that the skill and nimbleness of the Taskforce has enabled us to secure millions of doses of the first vaccine conditionally approved by the MHRA and that the British public are now starting to be protected with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Kate Bingham’s tenure as chair of the Vaccines Taskforce is due to conclude this month, as agreed when she was appointed earlier this year. Clive Dix, current deputy chair, will step into the role of interim chair of the VTF following her departure. The interim chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, Clive Dix said: The UK is now prepared to start dealing with COVID-19 with the first vaccines to prevent the disease. Although this is a huge success, there is more for us to do. We must continue to develop our research and response capabilities in the UK and finish the task of building an infrastructure to enable us to manufacture vaccines at scale. In less than 6 months, the VTF has built a portfolio of 7 different vaccines from more than 240 vaccines in development across 4 different formats: adenoviral vectors, mRNA, adjuvanted proteins, and whole inactivated viral vaccines. This includes 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 100 million doses of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine and 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine. Internationally, the UK has committed to ensuring that everyone at risk of coronavirus, anywhere in the world, has access to a safe and effective vaccine. To do this, the UK has committed up to £548 million to the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (Covax). It will deliver vaccines for the UK population and provide access to vaccines for lower income countries. Read the independent interim report. The Vaccines Taskforce (VTF) was set up under the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in May 2020, to ensure that the UK population has access to clinically effective and safe vaccines as soon as possible, while working with partners to support international access to successful vaccines. This is to place the UK at the forefront of global vaccine research, development, manufacture and distribution. The Vaccines Taskforce comprises a dedicated team of private sector industry professionals and officials from across government who are working at speed to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates that can end the global pandemic. It is chaired by biotech and life sciences expert Kate Bingham, who was appointed by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Vaccines Taskforce’s approach to securing access to vaccines is through: The 4 different vaccine classes that the government has secured to date for the UK are: Once approved by regulators, vaccines would first be given to priority groups such as frontline health and social care workers, the elderly and adults with underlying health conditions.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/governments-vaccines-taskforce-has-worked-decisively-and-at-great-pace-to-improve-uks-pandemic-preparedness"
"69","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020",2020-12-16,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020 It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history. And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves, beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable. With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this virus which makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter. Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control. And thanks to the colossal collective effort in November we did bring the R below 1 we did get the infection rate down. But I must be frank with you we are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country: Kent is still seeing rising infections the number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people. And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today. And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review. And so like every other European country facing similar challenges we have come to this moment, a great global festival a turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance. But also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution when we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptoms which is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected. And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rules and why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility. And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules. So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones, we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level, asking you to think hard and in detail about the days ahead and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others. We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message: a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas. When we say three households can meet on five days, I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for. And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet. And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas, we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday - to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible because this virus spreads from human contact. If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area and avoid staying away from home overnight if you can. Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year. So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others. And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated. And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day Sales And no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply. In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors. All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk. So have yourselves a merry little Christmas And I’m afraid this year I do mean little But with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking, We do know things will be better in this country by Easter And I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-december-2020"
"70","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 December 2020",2020-12-19,"Good afternoon, I am sorry to report that the situation has deteriorated since I last spoke to you three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London, the South East and the East of England than would be expected given the tough restrictions which are already in place. I also received an explanation for why the virus is spreading more rapidly in these areas. It appears this spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus, which we first learned about earlier this week. Our advisory group on New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats – NERVTAG – has spent the last few days analysing the new variant. There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or higher mortality, but it does appear to be passed on significantly more easily. NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant. This is early data. It is subject to review. It is the best we have at the moment, and we have to act on information as we have it because this is now spreading very fast. The U.K. has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we are better able to identify new strains like this than any other country. The Chief Medical Officer last night submitted our findings so far to the World Health Organisation and we will continue to be totally transparent with our global partners. There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant. Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now. I met ministers on the Covid Operations Committee last night and again first thing this morning, and Cabinet met at lunchtime to agree the following actions. First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November. That means: Residents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law.
Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close.
People must work from home if they can, but may travel to work if this is not possible, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
People should not enter or leave tier 4 areas, and tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home.
Individuals can only meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space. Unlike the November national restrictions, communal worship can continue to take place in tier 4 areas. These measures will take effect from tomorrow morning. All tiers will continue to be regularly reviewed in line with the approach previously set out, with the next formal review point taking place on 30 December. Second, we are issuing new advice on travel. Although the new variant is concentrated in tier 4 areas, it is nonetheless present at lower levels around the country. We are asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local. People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier. Those in tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes. Third, we must, I am afraid, look again at Christmas. As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned. In England, those living in tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas, though support bubbles will remain in place for those at particular risk of loneliness or isolation. Across the rest of the country, the Christmas rules allowing up to three households to meet will now be limited to Christmas Day only, rather than the five days as previously set out. As before, there will be no relaxation on 31 December, so people must not break the rules at New Year. I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence. As your Prime Minister, I sincerely believe there is no alternative open to me. Without action, the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives. I want to stress we are not alone in this fight – many of our European friends and neighbours are being forced to take similar action. We are working closely with the devolved administrations to protect people in every part of the UK. Of course there is now hope – real hope – that we will soon be rid of this virus. That prospect is growing with every day that passes and every vaccine dose administered. The UK was the first country in the western world to start using a clinically approve vaccine. So please, if the NHS contacts you then get your vaccine – and join the 350,000 people across the UK who have already had their first dose. Yes, Christmas this year will be very different, but we must be realistic. We are sacrificing our chance to see loved ones this Christmas, so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so we can see them at future Christmases. As sure as night follows day, we will beat back this virus. We will defeat it. And we will reclaim our lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-december-2020"
"71","Prime Minister announces Tier 4: 'Stay At Home' Alert Level in response to new COVID variant",2020-12-19,"The Prime Minister has announced tougher restrictions for large parts of South East England with a new Tier 4: ‘Stay at Home’ alert level. The decision follows a rapid rise in infections attributed to the rapid spread of a new variant of COVID-19. Based on preliminary modelling data, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) now consider that the new strain can spread significantly more quickly and could increase R by 0.4 or more. New and existing data will continue to be analysed as we learn more about the variant. As a result, the following areas will move from Tier 3 to Tier 4: In Tier 4 the ‘Stay At Home’ message will be put in law. As previously, there will be exemptions - including travelling for work or education, for childcare purposes, and for exercise. People should not enter or leave Tier 4 areas, and Tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home. Where people cannot work from home, they should still travel to work, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Non-essential retail, indoor leisure [such as swimming pools and gyms], indoor entertainment [such as cinemas, bowling alleys and casinos], and personal care sectors [such as nail bars, barbers and hairdressers] must all close. Tighter social contact restrictions will also be introduced, meaning one person can meet with one other person in an outside public space. Rules on support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain as currently, and communal worship can continue to take place. For the clinically extremely vulnerable, the same advice as in November applies in Tier 4 areas. This says that those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, which includes people with certain types of cancer, people on immunosuppression therapy, and people with severe respiratory conditions, shouldn’t go to work and should limit time outside the home, and take exercise outside at less busy times. The Prime Minister, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Scientific Advisor and Cabinet agreed that while no-one wants to impose these tougher measures, the new variant has significantly changed the current landscape and urgent action is needed to protect the NHS and save lives. Throughout the pandemic, the evidence has shown that rising rates will lead to increased hospital admissions, risking intolerable pressure on the NHS in the toughest winter months. There is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate, that it affects vaccines and treatments, or that testing will not detect cases. The Prime Minister also said that given the risk the new variant poses, the Christmas bubble policy will no longer apply in Tier 4. For Tiers 1, 2 and 3, Christmas bubbles can continue with up to three households able to meet, but for one day only on Christmas Day. The government is also issuing new travel advice. Although the new variant is concentrated in Tier 4 areas, it is present at lower levels around the country. People under Tier 1, 2, and 3 restrictions should stay local. People should not travel into or out of Tier 4 areas and those in Tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad, apart from limited exceptions including work and education. Tier 4 rules will be reviewed on 30 December, as part of the wider review of all restrictions.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-tier-4-stay-at-home-alert-level-in-response-to-new-covid-variant"
"72","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020",2020-12-30,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020 Today I want to begin with the good news: the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which is a fantastic achievement for British science And which will allow us to vaccinate more people, and also vaccinate them more quickly. And there is one important development that’s helping us to accelerate our vaccination programme across the whole of the UK: We’ve had new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the first dose can protect people against the worst effects of this virus because the benefits kick in after two or three weeks. And so from now on we will give a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible, with the second dose to follow twelve weeks later. And what that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks. I know everyone watching this will want to know when you can get your vaccine and all I want to say is we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you, and as soon as we have the supplies we will be getting them into people’s arms To summarise where we are We have to face the fact we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid - One is working for us; and one working against us. On the plus side we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out. On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. And we have seen a 40 per cent increase in cases in England in the last week alone, almost 15 per cent more patients in hospital – more than at the peak of the first wave. And yesterday sadly we recorded almost a thousand deaths across the UK, for the first time since April. So at this critical moment with the prospect of freedom within reach We’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus. That’s why the Health Secretary has announced that more areas of England will be moving into Tier 4 from tomorrow And as I say again, no-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do. But we must take firm action now and that’s why we have to think very hard about schools. Because today of course it remains the case that keeping children in education is a national priority it remains the case that schools are safe. But we must face the reality that the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas and that does affect schools Let me set out for you what this means. In most of England, primary schools will still reassemble next week, as planned for the new term. But, in the areas we have just published today on gov.uk, I am afraid the start of the new term will be delayed until at least January 18, when the latest data on those infection rates will be reviewed. That is because the rate of transmission in these areas is so high, and there’s just such pressure on the local NHS, that extra action is required to control the spread of the virus. The children of key workers, or those who are considered to be vulnerable, will still go back to primary schools from next week – wherever they live in England. They are not affected by today’s announcement. In secondary schools, all vulnerable children and the children of critical workers will go back next week across England, as originally planned. But we will ask exam year pupils in secondary schools to learn remotely during the first week of term and return to the classroom from 11 January. The remaining secondary school pupils, i.e. non exam groups will go back a week later, that is from 18 January – but I want to stress that depending on the spread of the disease it may be necessary to take further action in their cases as well, in as I say the worst affected areas. To minimise disruption in schools and to fight the disease we are massively expanding our testing operation ensuring that every secondary school pupil is tested as they return, and regularly thereafter. Again I want to thank the teachers, pupils and parents who have worked so hard to keep schools safe and keep them open. We are also asking universities to reduce the number of students who return to campus in January, prioritising medical courses and others requiring face to face teaching. And in all cases, students should be offered two rapid tests when they return. All of these measures are in the end designed to save lives and to protect the NHS. And for that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home. That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind. We are still in the tunnel of this pandemic the light however is not merely visible: thanks to an extraordinary feat of British engineering if you like the tunnel has been shortened and we are moving faster through it, and that gives me great confidence about the future in the Spring So for now let’s double our efforts, let’s follow the rules, protect our NHS and together make 2021 the year we leave this tunnel behind us.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-december-2020"
"73","Prime Minister's address to the nation: 4 January 2021",2021-01-04,"Prime Minister’s address to the nation: 4 January 2021 Since the pandemic began last year, the whole United Kingdom has been engaged in a great national effort to fight Covid. And there is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work. But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible – that means you are much, much more likely to catch the virus and to pass it on. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000. That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones. With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home. You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if you absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape domestic abuse. The full details on what you can and can’t do will be available at gov.uk/coronavirus. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you. And because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries. We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. We will provide extra support to ensure that pupils entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them while schools are closed, and we’ll distribute more devices to support remote education. I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country. Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner. The answer is simply that we have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open, because we know how important each day in education is to children’s life chances. And I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe for children – children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by even the new variant of Covid. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households. Today the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officers have advised that the country should move to alert level 5, meaning that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days. Of course, there is one huge difference compared to last year. We are now rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in our history. So far, we in the UK have vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined. With the arrival today of the UK’s own Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine, the pace of vaccination is accelerating. I can share with you tonight the NHS’s realistic expectations for the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. By the middle of February, if things go well and with a fair wind in our sails, we expect to have offered the first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. That means vaccinating all residents in a care home for older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus. And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long. I must stress that even if we achieve this goal, there remains a time lag of two to three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity. And there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. So we should remain cautious about the timetable ahead. But if our understanding of the virus doesn’t change dramatically once again… If the rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful… If deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect… And, critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules… Then I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers. I want to say to everyone right across the United Kingdom that I know how tough this is, I know how frustrated you are, I know that you have had more than enough of government guidance about defeating this virus. But now more than ever, we must pull together. You should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Parliament will meet – largely remotely – later that day. I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland share my conviction this is a pivotal moment and they’re taking similar steps. The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we are entering the last phase of the struggle. Because with every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people. And, thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight and we know exactly how we will get there. But for now, I am afraid, you must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you all very much.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-address-to-the-nation-4-january-2021"
"74","Prime Minister announces national lockdown",2021-01-04,"The Prime Minister has announced a national lockdown and instructed people to stay at home to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives. The decision follows a rapid rise in infections, hospital admissions and case rates across the country, and our hospitals are now under more pressure than they have been at any other point throughout the pandemic. This drastic jump in cases has been attributed to the new variant of COVID-19, which our scientists have now confirmed is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible. On 4 January, there were 26,626 Covid patients in hospital in England, an increase of over 30% in one week, and the April 2020 hospital admissions peak has now been surpassed by 40%. The case rate in England up to 29 December was 478.5 per 100k, three times higher than on 1 December when the case rate was 151.3. On 3 Jan, 454 deaths were reported, with 4,228 over the last 7 days – a 24% increase on the previous 7 days. This afternoon, the four UK Chief Medical Officers have advised that the COVID threat level should move from level four to level five, indicating that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days. The Prime Minister praised everyone’s collective efforts to get this virus under control, emphasising the great national effort to fight Covid. Despite this, the pressure on our NHS, rapidly rising infection rates and hospital admissions due to the new variant mean that another national lockdown is sadly necessary. From tomorrow, people will only be allowed to leave their homes for the following reasons: From tomorrow, all primary schools, secondary schools and colleges will move to remote learning, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable children. While children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by COVID-19, the government recognises that schools must be included in the restrictions in order to have the best chance of getting the virus under control as schools can act as vectors of transmission, causing the virus to spread between households when rates are high. Schools will be required to provide remote education for those learning at home. Early years settings such as nurseries, alternative provision and special schools will remain open and vulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to use registered childcare, childminders and other childcare activities. The government is also advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again, and letters will be sent to individuals with advice on what this means for them. All non-essential retail, hospitality and personal care services must close, or remain closed. Restaurants can continue delivery, takeaway or click-and-collect of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but venues will no longer be able to serve takeaway or click-and-collect alcohol. Essential shops and garden centres can remain open. Entertainment venues and animal attractions such as zoos must close, but the outdoor areas of venues such as heritage homes and botanical gardens can remain open, to be used for exercise. Playgrounds may also remain open. Places of worship can also remain open, but you may only visit with your household. Indoor and outdoor sports facilities including sports courts, gyms, golf courses, swimming pools, and riding arenas must also close. Elite sport and disabled sport can continue, as can PE lessons for those children attending school. The restrictions will come into effect tomorrow, and are expected to last until the middle of February if the situation in hospitals improve. By this point, the NHS hopes to have vaccinated everyone in the top four priority groups identified by the JCVI – including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will protect those at highest risk from COVID-19 and this will remove a significant amount of the pressure currently facing the NHS. Based on the latest available data, the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined and we will continue to accelerate our vaccination programme at pace. Everyone should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law from 00.01 on Wednesday. Parliament will sit, largely remotely, on Wednesday to debate and vote on the measures. The full details on what you can and cannot do are available here.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-national-lockdown"
"75","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021",2021-01-05,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021 Good afternoon, I want to update everybody about vaccines because across this entire country today there are people – everybody - making another huge sacrifice. Teachers and pupils coping with online learning Businesses who have borne the brunt of successive lockdowns and, of course, the amazing staff of our NHS and our care workers who are grappling with a new variant - this new variant - of coronavirus. And I believe that when everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice when the Office of National Statistics is telling us that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than at the first peak in April. I think obviously – everybody, you all - want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. And I can tell you that this afternoon we have now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80 And that means that nearly 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in 2 to 3 weeks – all of them - a significant degree of immunity. And when you consider that the average age of Covid fatalities is in the 80s You can see the importance of what we have already achieved. And that is why I believe that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was right to draw up a programme aimed at saving the most lives the fastest. So by February 15th, as I said last night, the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And to help us with meeting this target we already have 595 GP-led sites providing vaccines, with a further 180 coming on stream later this week. We have 107 hospital sites – with a further 100 later this week So that is almost a thousand sites – vaccination sites - across the country by the end of this week And next week we will also have 7 vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. We know that there will still be long weeks ahead in which we must persevere with these restrictions but I want to give you – the British people – the maximum possible transparency about this vaccine roll out with more detail on Thursday and daily updates from Monday so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making. Thanks very much I am now going to hand over to Chris to do the slides.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-january-2021"
"76","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on COVID-19 regulations: 6 January 2021",2021-01-06,"Thank you very much Mr Speaker and can I share your gratitude to the House of Commons staff for all their efforts, their hard work to allow us to meet today in the way that we are. And before I begin my statement, I know the thoughts of the whole House are with the Hon Member for Cardiff Central who is currently in hospital with Covid, and we wish her a full and speedy recovery. With permission, I shall make a statement about the measures we are taking to defeat this new variant of Covid-19, protecting our NHS whilst it carries out the vaccinations that will finally free us from this wretched virus. And Mr Speaker, there is a fundamental difference between the regulations before the House today, and the position we have faced at any previous stage, because now we have the vaccines that are the means of our escape and we will use every available second of the lockdown to place this invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable. Already – with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – we have immunised over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million in the UK. Our NHS is following the plan drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which is aimed at saving the most lives in the fastest possible time. And given that the average age of Covid fatalities is over 80, it is significant that we have already vaccinated more than 650,000 people in this age group, meaning that within 2 to 3 weeks, almost 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will all have a significant degree of immunity. By February 15th the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff everyone over 70 all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And in working towards that target there are already almost 1,000 vaccination centres across the country including 595 GP-led sites with a further 180 opening later this week and 107 hospital sites – with another 100 later this week Next week we will also have seven vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. Pharmacies are already working with GPs to deliver the vaccine in many areas of the country and I am grateful to Brigadier Prosser who is leading the efforts of our armed forces in supporting this vaccine rollout. We have already vaccinated more people in this country than in the rest of Europe combined and we will give the House the maximum possible transparency about our acceleration of this effort publishing daily updates online from Monday so that jab by jab Hon Members can scrutinise the progress being made every single day. Yet as we take this giant leap towards finally overcoming this virus and reclaiming our lives, we have to contend with the new variant which is between 50 and 70 per cent more contagious. The old variant, which the House agreed last month, the tiers agreed by this House last month was working with the old variant. But, alas, this mutation spreading with frightening ease and speed in spite of the sterling work of the British public – has led to more cases than we have ever seen before, alas numbers that cannot be explained away by the meteoric rise in testing. When the Office for National Statistics reports that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April, it is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. And so we now have no choice but to return to a national lockdown in England with similar measures being adopted by the Devolved Administrations – so we can control this new variant until we can take the most likely victims out of its path with vaccines. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health will open the debate on the full regulations shortly, but the key point I am afraid is that we are once again instructing everyone to stay at home, everyone to stay at home leaving only for limited reasons permitted by law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if people absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape injury or harm, including domestic abuse. We are advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. And because we must do everything possible to stop the spread of the disease we have asked schools and colleges to close their doors to all except vulnerable children and those of critical workers. Mr Speaker, I don’t think the House will be in any doubt about our determination, my determination to keep schools open, especially primary schools – open for as long as possible. Because all the evidence shows that school is the best place for our children. And indeed all the evidence shows that schools are safe, and that the risk posed to children by Coronavirus is vanishingly small. For most children the most dangerous part of going to school, even in the midst of this global pandemic, remains I’m afraid crossing the road in order to get there. But the data showed, and our scientific advisers agreed, that our efforts to contain the spread of this new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential  vector for spreading the virus between households. Mr Speaker, I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all the teachers, all the pupils and parents who are now making the rapid move to remote learning, and we will do everything possible to support that process, building on the 560,000 laptops and tablets provided last year with over 50,000 delivered to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 being delivered in total during the first week of term. We have partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile operators to provide free mobile data to disadvantaged families to support access to education resources. And I am very grateful to EE, Three, Tesco Mobile, Smarty, Sky Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone for supporting this offer. Oak National Academy will continue to provide video lessons and it’s very good news that the BBC is launching the biggest education programme in its history, with both primary and secondary school programmes across its platforms. We recognise it will not be possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this Summer as normal. And the Education Secretary will be making a statement shortly. Mr Speaker, I know many people will ask whether the decision on schools could have been reached sooner, and the answer is that we have been doing everything in our power to keep them open because children’s education is too vital, and their futures too precious, to be disrupted until every other avenue, every other option had been closed off and every other course of action had been taken. That is why schools were the very last thing to close, as I have long promised they would be. And when we begin to move out of lockdown I promise they will be the very first things to reopen. That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. That is why the legislation this House will vote on later today runs until 31 March. Not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis carefully brick-by-brick as it were breaking free of our confinement but without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us. The restrictions will be kept under continuous review, with a statutory requirement to review every two weeks and a legal obligation to remove them if they are no longer deemed necessary to limit the transmission of the virus. And for as long as restrictions are in place we will continue to support everyone affected by them from the continued provision of free school meals to the £4.6 billion of additional assistance for our retail, hospitality and leisure sectors announced by my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor yesterday. Mr Speaker, we are in a tough final stretch made only tougher by the new variant – but this country will come together and the miracle of scientific endeavour, much of it right here in the UK, has given us not only the sight of the finish line but a clear route to get there. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in every arm makes a difference, As I say we are already vaccinating faster than any comparable country and that rate I hope will only increase. But if we’re going to win this race for our population we have to give our army of vaccinators the biggest head start we possibly can. And that is why to do that we must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. And I commend this statement to the House.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-covid-19-regulations-6-january-2021"
"77","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021",2021-01-07,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021 Good afternoon, today I’m joined by Sir Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England and Brigadier Phil Prosser, who is Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme across our United Kingdom. Because I know there is now one question at the very top of your minds and that is how fast and how effectively we can get these millions of new vaccines into the arms of the most vulnerable and those who need them most. And you want to know that we in government, the NHS, the Armed Forces, local and regional government, government at every level are truly throwing everything at it round the clock if necessary. And I believe that with the country once again in lockdown and all the difficulties that means for you, for your family, for students, for education, for your businesses, and of course with the tragic number of deaths that we’re seeing and that we’ve seen today, you have a right to understand exactly how we are cracking this problem and how the national vaccine effort is progressing. And you rightly want to know how we are going to reach the target that I set out earlier this week of offering a slot for vaccination by 15th of February for everyone in those key groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation That’s over 12 million people in England, and 15 million in the UK including older care home residents and staff everyone 70 or over all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And just to remind you of the importance of these groups for fighting the disease they account for 88 per cent of all those who have sadly lost their lives. And so our tactics are first to use the immense natural capacity of the NHS and by the end of next week there will be over 1,000 GP-led sites providing vaccines 223 hospital sites seven giant vaccination centres and a first wave of 200 community pharmacies If all goes well these together should have the capacity to deliver hundreds of thousands of vaccines per day by Jan 15th and it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles. And it follows from that that the limits will not be on our distributional power but on the supply of vaccines. And I have no doubt that we have enough supply to vaccinate these four groups by the Feb 15th deadline and we also have the distributional network to do it and to continue an expanding programme down that priority list. Yes, let’s be clear this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we have seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. And, of course there will be difficulties appointments will be changed but as Brigadier Prosser will shortly explain the army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace. We will publish our full vaccine deployment plan on Monday along with daily updates on the progress we are making. We have now vaccinated 1.26 million people in England, 113,000 in Scotland, 49,000 in Wales, and 46,000 in Northern Ireland. So altogether, nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now received their first dose and within 2-3 weeks all of them will have a very considerable degree of immunity. And it is thanks to the arrival of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which can be stored at room temperature, that we can accelerate the pace of vaccination in care homes. We are using that vaccine in care homes for the first time today and by the end of the month we hope to have offered every elderly care home resident a vaccine. Our new National Booking Service will also make it easier to book and access appointments So I urge everyone to comes forwards because it’s absolutely vital that we should have confidence in these vaccines. And I want to thank everyone involved in this extraordinary national effort all the GPs, nurses, pharmacists and all the staff behind the scenes our armed forces local councils our scientists who have not only developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the first ever life-saving treatment of Covid in the form of dexamethasone – but I am pleased to tell you today, British scientific research has now contributed to the creation of more new lifesaving treatments that have just passed rigorous clinical trials. In particular, Tocilizumab, sorry I’ll say it again, Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, they’ll shortly be on everybody’s lips which have been found to reduce the risk of death for critically ill patients by almost a quarter and they’ve cut time spent in intensive care by as much as ten days and these lifesaving drugs will be available through the NHS with immediate effect, potentially saving thousands of lives. And finally again I want to thank you – the British public – for coming forward to be vaccinated in the numbers that you have - still greater than all the countries of Europe put together. And yes of course, we are in a race against time but I can assure you we’re doing everything we can to vaccinate as many people as possible across our whole United Kingdom. And in the meantime please stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. And now I’ll hand over to Sir Simon Stevens","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-7-january-2021"
"78","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021",2021-01-15,"Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021 Good afternoon. As you know, this country is engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, and the chances are that you know someone personally who has already received a vaccine. But it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on our NHS are extraordinary. On Tuesday we saw 4,134 new admissions to hospital on a single day, the highest at any point in this pandemic. There are now more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospital across the UK and, in spite of all the efforts of our doctors and nurses and our medical staff, we are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards. And with 55,761 positive cases since yesterday and, very sadly, 1,280 deaths, this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives. And please remember that this disease can be passed on not just by standing too near someone in a supermarket queue, but also by handling something touched by an infected person. And remember also that 1 in 3 people with Covid have no symptoms, and that is why that original message of hands, face and space, washing your hands, is as important now as it has ever been. And it is precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country. So, yesterday we announced that we are banning flights from South America and Portugal. And, to protect us against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains, we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday. Following conversations with the devolved administrations, we will act together so that this applies across the whole of UK This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you have taken in the 72 hours before leaving and you must have filled in your Passenger Locator Form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off. You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to comply And, upon arrival, you must then quarantine for ten days – not leaving your home for any reason at all, or take another test on day 5 and wait for proof of another negative result. And we will be stepping up our enforcement – both at the border and in-country. And it is vital to take these extra measures now when day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population. We have now vaccinated over 3.2 million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week. That’s 2.8 million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland. Yesterday alone, we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, and that is still far more than any other country in Europe. And with almost 45 per cent of our over 80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk. And I pay particular tribute to the vaccination efforts going on in Cockermouth, in Cumbria, Yateley and Cheltenham, where they have vaccinated around 90 per cent of their over-80s in their communities. And I’ll also pay tribute to North Lincolnshire, to Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where vaccination teams have protected over 80 per cent of their care home residents. And it’s thanks to that amazing constellation of the vaccination teams: doctors and nurses armed forces, local authorities, pharmacies and volunteers that we are steadily building up that immunity, that protection for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all. So, when the call comes, please do get a jab and, in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-january-2021"
"79","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 January 2021",2021-01-22,"Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have tried to update you as soon as possible about changes in the scientific data or the analysis. So, I must tell you this afternoon that we have been informed today that, in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant – the variant that was first identified in London and the South East – may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, and I’m going to ask Patrick in a minute to say a bit more about that. Because it is largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure, with another 40,261 positive cases since yesterday. We have 38,562 COVID patients now in hospital, that’s 78 per cent higher than the first peak in April and, tragically, there have been a further 1,401 deaths. So, it is more important than ever that we all remain vigilant in following the rules and that we stay at home, protect the NHS and thereby save lives. But I also want to answer a key question that I know will be uppermost in your minds. All current evidence continues to show that both the vaccines we are currently using remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant. And so, you will also want to know that our immunisation programme continues at an unprecedented rate. 5.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine and over the last 24 hours we can report a record 400,000 vaccinations. In England one in ten of all adults have received their first dose, including 71 per cent of over-80s and two thirds of elderly care home residents. Having secured orders for hundreds of millions of doses, the U.K. government has supplied vaccines to the Devolved Administrations, according to population size. First doses have been administered now to 151,000 people in Northern Ireland, 358,000 in Scotland and 212,000 in Wales. And I am glad that the whole of the U.K. is able to assist the Devolved Administrations in deploying the vaccine and I know everyone across the country is grateful for the logistical skill of the British Army. There is much more to do, and the target remains very stretching indeed, but we remain on track to reach our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And I want to thank all the doctors and nurses, especially at the GP-led sites who are vaccinating at a phenomenal rate, as well as, as I say, all those in our armed forces, our local authorities, our pharmacies and volunteers, who are making this extraordinary national effort possible. And I want to thank all of you who have come forward to get your jabs, because, by doing that, you are protecting yourselves, your communities and, of course, our NHS. And I say to everyone, when that letter arrives, please don’t hesitate to book that appointment and get this life-saving protection, because this is the best and fastest way for us all to defeat this virus and get our lives back to normal.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-january-2021"
"80","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 January 2021",2021-01-26,"I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye. I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one: fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken. And, to all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others. We will remember the courage of countless working people – not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others – who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War. We will commemorate the small acts of kindness, the spirit of volunteering and the daily sacrifice of millions who placed their lives on hold time and again as we fought each new wave of the virus, buying time for our brilliant scientists to come to our aid. In that moment of commemoration, we will celebrate the genius and perseverance of those who discovered the vaccines and the immense national effort – never seen before in our history – which is now underway to distribute them, one that has now seen us immunise over 6.8 million people across the United Kingdom. And when those vaccines have finally freed us from this virus and put us on a path to recovery, we will make sure that we learn the lessons and reflect and prepare. And, until that time, the best and most important thing we can all do to honour the memory of those who have died is to work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease. And that is what we will do.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-january-2021"
