Thank you all for joining us. Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen COVID-19 spread around the globe. Here in Canada, 93 cases have been reported and on Monday, one person died. Before we go any further, I want to extend my sincere condolences to their family and friends. Our thoughts are with them as they navigate through this difficult time. From the start, we have taken a whole-of-government approach to limit the spread of COVID-19 and keep Canadians safe. We are working very closely with our municipal, provincial, and territorial counterparts to mitigate the risks to the population. Members of the Incident Response Group are meeting regularly to report on the situation. Minister Hajdu and Dr. Tam are keeping Canadians up to date on the latest developments and are issuing recommendations daily. Ministers Bains, Joly, Morneau, and Ng are closely monitoring the current and potential impacts of the virus on various sectors of our economy. And Minister Champagne is working with our international partners and the World Health Organization to contain the virus globally. As we saw an uptick in the total number of cases around the globe, we took additional steps. Last week, we announced a special committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, to manage the federal response to the outbreak. We’ve also put in place screening measures at airports. We’ve increased testing at the National Microbiology Laboratory. We’ve invested in research. We’ve bolstered support for health services in Indigenous communities. But the reality is that the number of people affected by the virus around the globe keeps climbing. Canada has been fortunate so far. We have not seen a drastic spike in the number of cases reported, but I know that people across the country are worried. Worried about their health, worried about their aging parents, worried about the kind of impact this virus could have on their job, on their business. Since Day 1, our government has been following the situation very closely. We have a responsibility to make sure Canada is ready for all scenarios and we take that responsibility extremely seriously. That’s why today, we’re announcing a comprehensive package to address the impacts of COVID-19 on our country and to keep Canadians safe. Our government will be creating a $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund, which will provide money to the provinces and territories to deal with preparation for, and mitigation of, the virus. I want all premiers and all Canadians to know: Our government is here for you. We will make sure you have everything you need. The fund will provide $200 million to support the ongoing federal response to the virus, including more money for things like surgical masks and face shields, increased capacity for services to Indigenous peoples and other federal health care responsibilities, and for continued public education efforts to Canadians. It will also invest $275 million in additional funding for research on medical countermeasures, including vaccine development and support for clinical trials. On the economic front, our government understands the disruptive impact the virus is having on businesses and workers. That’s why we will waive the mandatory one-week waiting period for Employment Insurance to kick in. We’re also introducing, among other things, special measures under the Work-Sharing program to help employers who fall on hard times due to COVID-19. Let me be clear. No one should have to worry about their job if they have to be quarantined. No employer should feel like they have to lay off a worker because of the virus. We can support you and we will. Today’s announcement is significant, but we are already preparing to do more if need be. Should businesses face a cash crunch in the short term, they can easily access credit to bridge to better times. We will work with our financial Crown corporations through the Business Credit Availability Program to protect jobs and to be there for businesses. As we saw over the past few days, the outbreak is having an impact on the global economy. It’s affecting supply chains, commodity prices, our oil and gas sector, tourism, and more. I know this is adding to people’s anxieties. With a strong balance sheet and a resilient economy – Canada is well positioned to deal with these challenges. Canadians can count on us to provide them with the right kind of support as the situation progresses. Right now, countries with fragile health care systems are more at risk of seeing the virus spread. That is why our government will also allocate $50 million to help countries that are especially vulnerable. To address COVID-19, Canada is looking at the current situation from a global perspective. First, we are making additional investments to ensure that our health care system and health care professionals are ready for all eventualities. Next, we are working with our international partners to ensure they have the resources they need to prevent the virus from spreading in their countries and around the world. I know that people are worried about what they’re seeing on the nightly news and what it means for their community. We get it. And we’re on it. We’re working with our international partners to contain the virus. We’re applying the lessons we learned during the SARS outbreak. We’re making sure our health care systems are resilient. We are pulling out all the stops to make sure Canadians stay safe, healthy, and supported. Canada is among the best prepared countries in the world to respond to the situation we’re facing. We will get through what comes next together. Once again, thank you for being here today. I will now take your questions."

Before I get to today’s announcement, I want to say a few words about travel. We’re in discussion with Canadian airlines to help Canadians stranded abroad come home. We will have more details to share, but the first flight will be picking up Canadians from Morocco this weekend. As I announced Wednesday, Canada and the United States have agreed to stop non-essential travel, specifically for tourism and recreation.  Trade and commerce will continue. This takes effect at midnight tonight and Minister Blair will give more details today. Further, today Canada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement where we will now be returning irregular migrants who attempt to cross anywhere at the Canada-U.S. border. Over the past week, the entire country has mobilized to slow the spread of COVID-19. Retired doctors and nurses will help out at hospitals. The technicians administering the screening tests, and the researchers trying to find a vaccine, are working increasingly long hours. And above all, people are following the recommendations issued by our public health agencies. People are washing their hands regularly. People are working from home and travelling as little as possible to protect their health and the health of others. But it’s not just individuals who are looking to help their communities. Businesses are also doing their part. I think, for example, of the grocery stores that are opening an hour early to serve the most vulnerable and the manufacturing firms that are asking us if they can help. Just last week, a number of companies across the country contacted our government to offer their assistance. I want to thank them for their solidarity and their generosity. This week, many businesses put their hand up and asked us what they can do. So today, we’re announcing a new strategy that will make it easier for companies to help out during this critical time. We are launching Canada’s Plan to Mobilize Industry to fight COVID-19 to ensure that we can quickly produce here in Canada the things we need. This initiative will help companies that are already making things like masks, ventilators, and hand sanitizer to massively scale up production. It will also provide support to those who want to re-tool their manufacturing facilities to contribute to this fight. For example, the Auto Parts Manufacturer’s Association reached out to us asking how they could help. Our health care professionals really need support, so our government will help these companies shift production from auto parts to medical supplies. We’re also close to reaching agreements with several companies, including Thornhill Medical, Medicom, and Spartan Bioscience. Minister Bains and Minister Anand will have more to say on this later today. Our government is also creating new, innovative procurement streams to allow more businesses to develop solutions and products Canadians need because of COVID-19. We will expedite these streams, so firms can get to work quickly and these products are ready to use as soon as possible. Canada is home to some of the best innovators in the world and with this new initiative, we will harness their talent and know-how to get through these challenging times. Over the past week, Service Canada and many government agencies have received a historic number of calls from concerned Canadians. We received over 500,000 applications so far this week compared to just under 27,000 applications for the same week last year. I know people are anxious to get the help they deserve and our government is working as fast as possible to support them. This is of course an unprecedented situation and it’s putting a lot of pressure on our system, but we’re on it. Thousands of public servants are working around the clock to help you. I know this past week has been hard on people, for many reasons. Working from home while the kids are running around, not being able to visit your parents at their nursing home, not hanging out with your friends – it can take its toll. But it is in these challenging times that we also see what we’re made of. This past week, no matter how difficult, was further proof that Canadians are generous, kind, and compassionate and that should give us all hope. We all understand our responsibility as Canadians. We have to do the right thing – whether it’s working from home or practising social distancing – to protect our nurses, doctors, and everyone who works in our health care system. To deal with this crisis, we need everyone – citizens, businesses, and governments – to come together and do their part. That’s what we’ve seen right across the country. I want to thank all the workers who are stepping up and all the companies who are making the things our country needs. And if you own a business and you’re wondering what you can do, reach out. We need your help. Canadians need your help. And our government is ready to work with you to maximize your impact. I will end this morning by addressing all those celebrating Nowruz today and this past week. This is usually a time when friends and families gather around the haft-seen table and share a festive meal, but this year is a bit different. To the many families who’ve been spending their first Nowruz without loved ones lost in the Ukraine International Airlines tragedy: know that all Canadians mourn with you. I also know that many have had to postpone festivities because of COVID-19 and I want to thank you for that as well. Social distancing is crucial in limiting the spread of the virus and if we do this now, soon we will be able to celebrate together. In the meantime, I want to wish you all a very happy New Year – Nowruz etan Pyrouz – and I look forward to marking the occasion with you again in the future. Once again, thank you for being here."
"3","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/03/26/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-covid-19-situation","Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on the COVID-19 situation",2020-03-26,"Hello everyone. Yesterday, our plan to help Canadians, save jobs, and support our economy was adopted by Parliament. With more generous measures to help even more Canadians, we’re now talking about $107 billion to support people and businesses.  We launched the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which will provide $2,000 a month, for up to 4 months, to people who are not getting paid as a result of COVID-19. This will replace the two benefits we announced last week, to make it even simpler for you to get help. Whether you are eligible for employment insurance or not, this benefit is there to help you. An application portal will launch as quickly as possible, and people should start receiving money within 10 days of applying. As part of this plan, we’ll also be boosting the Canada Child Benefit for families in May. Parents already know how much the CCB helps with the costs of raising kids. By increasing the CCB, we will put even more money in the pockets of families to help them navigate these uncertain times. We’ll also be supplementing the GST credit, which is sent to low-income Canadians every few months. And for people who are still paying off their student loans, we’re putting a six-month, interest-free moratorium on their Canada Student Loans. You can find more information on what else we’re doing and how to access your benefits at canada.ca. I’m sorry to say there appears to be a text scam going around on the new Emergency Response Benefit. I want to remind everyone that the government’s website is the best place to find reliable information on everything we’re doing. It’s clear that the pandemic is putting a lot of pressure on our health care systems, on employment insurance, and on the entire machinery of government. But please know that we are doing everything we can to reduce delays. I know that the bills are piling up and the pressure is mounting. A lot of families are worried, and with good reason. But we are working as quickly as possible to put money in your pockets. We also know that people abroad are still having trouble finding flights to come home, and we are continuing to work with airlines to bring them back to Canada. Yesterday, Air Transat announced two more flights to Montreal from El Salvador and Guatemala. At the same time, our government is in constant communication with our international partners, who are also facing this crisis. We’re looking at what worked for them, or even what didn’t work, to see if we can learn from their success. Earlier today, I spoke to G20 leaders. One thing is clear: we can only overcome COVID-19 if we take action together as a global community. So, we’re going to do whatever it takes. That means making sure the World Health Organization and our public health agencies have the resources they need. It means working together to develop a vaccine, identify treatments, and increase testing. We’re also expanding manufacturing capacity for critical medical equipment, and working to keep the supply chains moving to get that equipment to the people who need it. Our government is helping companies in Canada re-tool their manufacturing facilities to produce the things we all need. On the economy, the G20 has also made significant investments to help people and businesses get through this challenging time. And we are going to be working closely together to coordinate our efforts to protect the global economy. COVID-19 is a global crisis and it demands a global response. Now more than ever, we must work with our allies to protect people and the economy. And on that note, I announced this morning that I’m appointing Kirsten Hillman as our new Ambassador to the United States. Ambassador Hillman is a gifted and brilliant diplomat. She was instrumental in securing a good deal for Canada and for Canadians during NAFTA negotiations. Most recently, Ambassador Hillman played a key role as we worked with our southern neighbours to temporarily close the border, while keeping trade flowing. As we fight COVID-19, we must protect the supply chains on which we depend for things like fresh vegetables, medicine, and supplies for our health care systems. Our ports, railways, and trucks are vital to bringing in the things we need and I want to thank all the workers who are keeping our country moving. Every day, our government looks at what we need to do better to help you and keep you safe from this evolving crisis. So, in response to the fact that too many travellers are still not self-isolating upon returning to Canada, we’re taking greater action. I have been very clear on this. The premiers, Dr. Tam, and public health officials have all been very clear on this. If you’ve just returned from abroad, you have to go home and stay home for 14 days. But some people have not been taking this seriously. They‘re stopping by the grocery store on their way home from the airport. They’re getting together with friends after being away for March Break. This kind of conduct is not just disappointing. It’s dangerous. So now, a 14-day quarantine will be mandatory for all Canadians returning home from abroad. We are implementing the Quarantine Act to keep all Canadians safe. If you do not comply with these instructions, you could face serious fines and even prison time. We all have a role to play in slowing the spread of this virus. What we are asking of you, it’s not complicated.   Stay home. Wash your hands. Keep your distance. Call your friends instead of going to see them. And above all, if you have just returned to the country, you must not leave your house at all for 14 days. We all want life to get back to normal, but for that to happen, everyone must do their part. Thank you."
"4","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/05/prime-ministers-remarks-thanking-workers-and-all-canadians-helping-their","Prime Minister’s remarks thanking workers and all Canadians for helping their communities during the COVID-19 situation",2020-04-05,"Hello everyone. Happy Sunday. This morning, I would first like to thank everyone working weekends. Truckers, grocers, pharmacists and health professionals—as always—thank you. But, today, I would also like to thank agricultural workers who feed our families. You are going through particularly tough times. But, thanks to you, we can stay home knowing that we can count on you to feed our families and our communities. We greatly appreciate everything that you are doing for us, and we will be there to support you. Over the past few weeks, we’ve all had to make changes to keep each other safe and healthy, and it’s a big adjustment. While we still have a lot of work to do, we’re making good progress on getting you the support you need as quickly as possible. And that’s what I want to start with today. Earlier this week, we announced more details on how you can access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you’ve lost your job or your paycheque. Starting tomorrow, you’ll be able to sign up to receive this support by going to Canada.ca. If you choose direct deposit, you will get a first payment within 3 to 5 days. If you choose to receive your benefit by mail, you’ll get money within the next 10 days. I know it can be hard to keep your spirits up these days. But one thing that should give us all hope is the way we’ve come together as a country. Crises such as this one test the limits of our solidarity. And in these difficult times, we’ve seen businesses step up to help protect our health care workers. We’ve seen doctors and nurses come out of retirement. We’ve seen people raise money for local food banks, check on their friends, and help our most vulnerable. Many of you may be wondering how you can help, and I want to remind you that the very best thing you can do to fight this pandemic is to follow public health recommendations. Wash your hands and stay at home, except for critical things like getting groceries or medications and try to make that trip only once a week. And if you do have to go out, keep a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others. That’s how you can keep doing your part. But for those of you with specialized skills looking to help our frontline workers, we do want to hear from you. Health Canada is building an inventory of specialized volunteers that provinces and territories can draw on to provide more support to our health care workers. This could include tracking cases and tracing contact, as well as collecting and reporting data. If you can help, please sign up online at Canada.ca/coronavirus. Applications will be open until April 24. We’re also offering full-time jobs to all reservists in the Canadian Forces. We’re contacting reservists across the country to see if they are interested and offering them the same pay and benefits as regular-force personnel for the coming months. Bolstering the military’s ranks will help offset some of the economic consequences of COVID-19 and ensure that our communities are well supported. In this crisis, everything you do counts. If you refuse to follow the experts’ advice, you are not just endangering your own life or that of your loved ones. You are endangering the health of all members of society. I’m not saying this to be dramatic. 233 Canadians have lost their lives because of COVID-19 and hundreds of families are now in mourning. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to all bereaved families. We are going through these difficult times together. We are here for you. To overcome this crisis, we all need to be aware of the consequences of our actions. If you do not do your part, your fellow citizens will pay the price. But it also works the other way. If you follow the experts’ advice, your whole community will benefit. So, let’s focus on doing just that. Let’s continue to do our part. That is how we will get through this challenge, together. And I want to close today with a message for kids. Thank you all for sending me your questions over the past few days. Dr. Tam and I had a great time answering those questions this morning.  Later today, astronauts Jeremy Hansen and David St-Jacques will be on YouTube, so be sure to tune in. David just returned to Earth after spending many months in space and he knows a thing or two about staying indoors and only talking to friends and family via video conference. I know these are tough times for kids and young people right across the country, and indeed around the world, but know that the support you’re giving your parents and all of us as we work through this, the way you’re helping out, the way you’re focusing on doing your homework and keeping your school work up, and the way you’re learning to adapt to this new situation that we will all remember for the rest of our lives. Thank you for everything you guys are doing to keep us getting through this. Thank you very much, everyone."
"5","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/10/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-covid-19-situation","Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on the COVID-19 situation",2020-04-10,"Hello, everyone. I know the long weekend coming is very important to many Canadians.  Whether you mark Good Friday or Passover, Easter, Tamil New Year or Vaisakhi, usually this is a time we spend together. You might go to church or to temple or to volunteer. Last year when I served a community lunch in Hamilton, I saw just how much people come together over these next few days.   But right now, this weekend is going to be very different. You’ll have to stay home. You’ll have to Skype that big family dinner. And the Easter egg hunt – well, it’ll have to happen around the house, instead of around the neighbourhood. I want to take a moment to have a word with all the kids out there – the Easter Bunny has a big job to do this year. And maybe there’s something you can do to help. Ask your parents to let you put up a picture in the window to bring some extra chocolate for nurses and doctors. They need a lot of energy to keep us all safe. And this is how you can help them to do their job. Regardless of our age, we all have a role to play to beat the coronavirus. Earlier this week, I mentioned that Health Canada had launched a call for volunteers to help our frontline workers. And already, over 27,000 people have signed up to lend a hand and give them a bit of respite. All across the country, many of you are doing your part, and I want to thank you. You are there for each other and I know that together, we will get through this.   These are tough times. But you don’t have to go through them alone. If you’ve lost your job and are having troubles making ends meet, you can apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Millions of people have already had their claim processed, and they’re getting their $2,000 deposit. Remember, you can apply today or this weekend, if you haven’t done so yet, by going to Canada.ca, or calling 1-800-959-2041. If you own a small business and are struggling to pay the bills or pay your staff, we launched the Canada Emergency Business Account yesterday. You can now get a $40,000 interest-free loan through your bank or credit union. And if you repay it within two years, 25% – up to $10,000 – of that loan is forgivable. It will only take a few days for you to receive the full amount in your account. That’s money you can use for whatever you need, whether it’s monthly expenses or paying employees. On that note, we’re getting closer to implementing the wage subsidy, too. We’re working with other parties to get this in place as quickly as possible. Tomorrow, we’re bringing back the House of Commons to pass the largest economic measures Canada has seen since World War II. It’s really important despite a time of crisis – in fact because of a time of crisis – that our institutions remain strong and our democratic principles continue. Therefore, this address to Canadians tomorrow will be a little later, and from the floor of the House of Commons. And on that note, I’ll be taking Sunday and Monday with Sophie and the kids. But I’ll be back Tuesday with more updates on how we’re helping you. If you just feel overwhelmed, we’ll soon have more to say about how you can access resources that can help.  If you’re in crisis, reach out. Lean on each other. And know that we will get through this, together. All across the country, there are stories of people stepping up to do their part. To ensure that Canadians are safe and our frontline workers have the support they need, we’re helping companies join in the effort. Look no further than Fluid Energy from Alberta. They will produce over a million litres of hand sanitizer each month, with shipments starting as early as next week. We’ve invested in this large-scale production, as part of our plan to have enough vital supplies produced right here at home. When Canadians work together, we get things done.  Last night, I spoke once again with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and the provincial and territorial premiers.   Right from the beginning, we’ve seen a lot of people join Team Canada, including the premiers. We’re all on the same wavelength, and we’re all working together to keep you safe. This long weekend, we all have to stay at home.   We can’t get together for dinner. And we’ll have to get creative to organize an Easter egg hunt inside the house. But being physically separated doesn’t mean we can’t be there for each other. Organize a family dinner on FaceTime. Call your friends. And if you can afford it, donate to charity.  This Easter long weekend won’t be like others, but I know that it will nevertheless be full of joy, laughter, and love. Thank you, everyone."
"6","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/15/prime-ministers-remarks-expansion-canada-emergency-response-benefit-and","Prime Minister’s remarks on the expansion of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and an update on testing supplies ",2020-04-15,"Hello, everyone. Before I get started, I want to take a moment to recognize Canadians who are doing some of the toughest jobs in the country. The women and men working in our hospitals, our seniors’ homes, and our long-term care facilities are making sacrifices every day. If you do one of these jobs – thank you. Thank you for keeping us safe and healthy, and protecting our loved ones. You deserve our full support. So if you need a hand getting through these tough times, we’ll be there for you. Today, we’re announcing more help for more Canadians. This includes topping up the pay of essential workers. At the same time, we’ll also be expanding the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to reach people who are earning some income, as well as for seasonal workers who are facing no jobs and for those who have run out of their EI regular benefits recently. And a little later, I’ll have some news about where we are with testing. You heard me speak in Parliament about the contributions of the Greatest Generation, who grew up during the Great Depression and fought through the Second World War. Today, across the country, the last members of this generation live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The uncomfortable and tragic truth is that the very places that care for our elderly are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. I will be addressing this with premiers tomorrow night.  We all need to do better, we all need to take leadership, for the seniors who have built this country.   Our government will work with the provinces and territories to boost wages for essential workers who are making under $2,500 a month, like those in our long-term care facilities. For many workers looking after the most vulnerable Canadians, including seniors and those with disabilities, we know conditions have gotten more difficult over the past weeks. And you need support right now. Tomorrow, in our weekly meeting, I will discuss with provincial and territorial leaders the importance of getting this wage boost in place as quickly as possible. As we face an unprecedented threat to public health, you are our most important line of defence. We will do whatever we can to help you do your job and support you through this time. In March, our government launched the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. This measure is part of a plan we implemented to ensure that everyone has the help they need to get through this difficult time. Millions of people have already received the benefit, but we know that a lot of people are not eligible and still need help. Today, I can announce that we are expanding the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to include people making up to $1,000 a month, seasonal workers, and people whose EI regular benefits have recently run out.   Maybe you’re a volunteer firefighter, or a contractor who can pick up some shifts, or you have a part-time job in a grocery store. Even if you’re still working, or if you want to start working again, you probably need help in making ends meet. So if you earn $1,000 or less a month, you’ll now be able to apply for the CERB. If you were expecting a seasonal job that isn’t coming because of COVID-19, you’ll now be able to apply. And if you’ve run out of EI regular benefits recently, you can now apply for the CERB as well. This context is also difficult for artists and creators across the country. Cultural spaces are closed and work is becoming scarce. Minister Guilbeault heard from artists asking that copyrights from work done before the crisis not be included to access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and that is what we’re going to do. So, in these anxious times, artists are continuing to help us think, to help us dream, and to shine a little light into our daily lives; and for this we are always grateful. And for others who still need help—including postsecondary students, and businesses worried about commercial rent—we’ll have more to say to you very soon. No matter who you are or where you live, we’re in your corner.  After having accepted the first demand for help from the Canadian Armed Forces for Nunavik, the Government of Québec sent us a second request for Basse-Côte-Nord. I can confirm that the Canadian Rangers will be there to provide support.  I want to thank our women and men in uniform, and the families who serve alongside them, for all that they do. Whenever we need you most, you’re always there for us. At times, we may feel overwhelmed by what is going on. We are in a situation that may seem unreal and it’s not always easy to deal with everything that’s happening around us. This week, the government launched a portal with all of the mental health resources that are available to you. Please visit canada.ca or use the Canada COVID-19 app to talk to someone. There is nothing wrong with feeling this way. The important thing is that you reach out.  Finally, we have more news today to share on testing. LuminUltra from New Brunswick, with whom we signed a contract, is now ramping up production to supply enough COVID-19 test chemicals to meet the weekly demand in all provinces. And in the last few days, we received a new batch of swabs to make sure every province has the supplies they need to keep testing. Whether it’s reagents or test kits, we are ensuring that Canada has the tools to fight this virus. Tomorrow, I’ll also be speaking with the other G7 leaders about continuing to coordinate a strong and effective global response to this pandemic. I know that everyone wants to know when life will be getting back to normal. And the reality is, we can’t give you a specific date. But this is what we do know: For this to end, you have to stay home. We have to limit how often we go out and stay two metres away from others. And if everyone does their part, we will get through this together.  Thank you."

Today at sundown marks the beginning of Ramadan. For many Muslim Canadians, the coming month will be different than normal, with iftar online and virtual Friday prayers. But that won’t change what this special time is all about – generosity, compassion, and service to others.   Across the country, Muslim Canadians are on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 as nurses, doctors, and essential workers. So thank you, and Ramadan Mubarak. This will be another difficult day for many families and communities across the country. We’re all thinking about those in Nova Scotia who are grieving the loss of loved ones, friends, and neighbours. Yesterday, I spoke with the families of some of the people we lost. They shared stories about their loved ones, and their dreams and plans. In the face of such tragedy, their strength is remarkable. I spoke also with RCMP members from the area and, on behalf of all Canadians, I thanked them for their service. And I spoke to some local mayors as well to express my condolences. For Torontonians, I know it’ll be a hard day as well, as we remember the victims of the van attack on Yonge Street two years ago. Together we mourn, and together we heal. Because just as Canadians were there for each other two years ago, we’re there for each other today. Across the country, people are hanging tartan, blue ribbons, and scarves from windows to honour those who died. With acts of kindness and donations, people are standing with families who are grieving. And tomorrow, with the virtual vigil, we will all have the chance to show the people of Nova Scotia that they are not alone.   These are tough times, but there is reason to hope.  When it comes to COVID-19, what we’re doing is working. And to continue on the right track, we need to be thinking not just about the next weeks, but about the next months. We need medium-term and long-term solutions.   On that front, I can announce today that we’re taking another step forward. We’re putting in place an additional $1.1 billion for a national medical research strategy to address COVID-19. This plan has three pillars: research on vaccines and other treatments, supports for clinical trials, and expanding national testing and modelling. Let me start with the first pillar on research. Under this plan, we are investing close to $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities across the country. This is on top of the funding we’ve already provided to support vaccine development in Canada. The second pillar of the plan is to make sure that once we have potential vaccines and treatments, we can test a wide range of options. Under this plan, we will invest over $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. A vaccine is the long-term solution to this virus. But these drugs will take months to develop, test, fabricate, and roll out. So until we have something ready, we need to control the spread of the virus. And that’s where the third pillar of this plan comes in. We’re investing $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19. This includes creating the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force. The task force will operate under the direction of a leadership group, which will include Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam, and Dr. Mona Nemer. We are bringing together top health experts and scientists from leading institutions across the country. Canada’s best and brightest will be working on serology testing – blood testing – to track and understand immunity to COVID-19. They’ll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we’ve already tested have had COVID-19, whether you’re immune once you’ve had it, and if so, how long that lasts. Over two years, we will be testing at least a million Canadians as a part of this study. The findings of the research will help with everything from rollouts of a potential vaccine, to determining which public health measures are most effective going forward. We will get valuable data, including disaggregated data, to understand the impact on vulnerable populations. And we will also leverage new and existing lab capacity for research. The better we understand this virus, its spread, and its impact on different people, the better we can fight it, and eventually defeat it. While this vital research is happening, we’re also staying focused on what we can do right now to control COVID-19 and get back to normal as soon as possible. Testing is key. We’ve now reached 20,000 tests daily, almost double where we were earlier this month. But testing must increase even further before we can re-open and re-start our normal activities as a country. You’ve been doing your part by staying home and practising physical distancing. It’s working. And we can’t afford to waste this progress. Right now, we’re seeing terrible tragedies in long-term care facilities across the country. This is unacceptable. If you’re angry, frustrated, scared – you are right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders – the greatest generation who built this country. We need to care for them properly. Canadians need to pull together. There have been requests for military assistance by both Ontario and Quebec, which of course we will be answering. Our women and men in uniform will step up with the valour and courage they have always shown. In the short term, we will be there with support so that provinces can get control of the situation. But this is not a long-term solution. In Canada, we shouldn’t have soldiers taking care of seniors. Going forward, in the weeks and months to come, we will all have to ask tough questions about how it came to this. We will all have to do more to get through this terrible situation. Everyone is working hard to get through this. We are all part of the same team. As we do our part, I know that everyone will be doing their part. We will get through this together, and we will come back strong together. Thank you."

Students are usually eager for May to come. Classes have ended, and you only have a couple of exams left. You’re looking forward to starting your summer job and spending more time with your friends. But not this year. The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and instability for everyone, including young people. Students who are about to graduate could not take advantage of their last semester as they had hoped. And now, they’re having trouble entering the labour market. Students who are still in school face similar hurdles. Work placements have been cancelled and summer jobs have become exceedingly rare. Many of you are wondering not just what you’re going to do for the next few months, but how you’ll pay your tuition next year. So, last week, we unveiled a $9 billion plan to help you get through this crisis. First, we announced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which will give students $1,250 a month throughout the summer. And if you have a disability or are taking care of a dependent, you’ll receive more. At the same time, we are investing to create an additional 76,000 jobs for students in sectors that need help or are actively contributing to the fight against COVID-19. These jobs are in addition to those offered under the Canada Summer Jobs program. If you can’t find a job this summer, but want to contribute in the fight against COVID-19, we’re going to make sure you have support, too. Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1,000 to $5,000 through the new Canada Student Service Grant for volunteer hours. We’re also going to be providing specific support for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation students. For graduate students and those conducting research, we’re going to extend scholarships, fellowships, and grants so your work can continue. And, we’re doubling student grants for low and middle income students for 2020/2021. Taken together, our government has a $9 billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months. Since we introduced this plan, we’ve been working with the opposition parties on legislation that will get this help to young people as quickly as possible. I’ll be heading to Parliament shortly, where we will introduce a bill to put the Canada Emergency Student Benefit in place. The pandemic has been hard on everyone and that’s why our government is stepping up to support you. To help parents who’ve got their hands full these days, our government will be boosting the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) payment in May. When schools closed, parents became teachers, restaurant owners, music teachers, and so much more. Isolation has been hard on families, and that is why we are boosting the CCB.  And to help lower income Canadians, we supplemented the GST Credit. I also want to remind everyone that this year, if you owe income tax, you have until August to make your payment. Yesterday, Minister Hajdu and Dr. Tam provided an update on our latest modelling. And the good news is that Canadians are stepping up to keep each other safe. In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened, so we have to keep it up. We’re seeing some progress because people from coast to coast to coast are making sacrifices and following public health rules. So let’s stick to it. Let’s stay home, wash our hands, and when we go out, let’s stay two metres away from others. Starting this weekend in Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds will head across Canada to salute Canadians doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19. As we watch the Snowbirds fly over our homes, let’s remember that we are all in this together."

Earlier today, we received the job report for April. These numbers tell us what we already knew – that right now, Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic. Everyone has their own story, but it all boils down to a very difficult time for a lot of people. Canadians aren’t alone in this, as the world faces COVID-19. But if you’re out of work, you don’t need to hear that other people are out of work, too. You need to know that there’s a plan to get you through this, and get you back on the job. And that’s exactly what this government is focused on. In the face of this unprecedented challenge, we’ve taken action. Maybe you’re one of the more than seven million people getting the CERB to help make ends meet. Or better yet, maybe thanks to the wage subsidy, your employer has been able to rehire you. That’s what happened for people who work at Pursuit, a Banff tourism company. They’re back on the job because of this program. We created the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to protect jobs wherever possible. Since it launched last week, employers have applied for subsidies for almost two million workers. And as provinces and territories start to gradually reopen over the coming months, and the CERB becomes less and less needed, this subsidy will play an even greater role. That’s why I can announce today that we will be extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy beyond June to help kick-start our economic re-opening and boost jobs. We’ll have more details next week, but to businesses hit by COVID-19, know this: the wage subsidy will continue to be there for you, to help you keep your employees on the payroll. So fill out the application at Canada.ca if you haven’t already done so. And if you had to let people go, try to bring them back. It’s those workers who will drive our economy’s short- and long-term recovery. Canadians want to work. So we’re going to help them get back to work.  On other support, the Canada Emergency Business Account has been accessed by well over half a million businesses to give them much-needed loans. Between the CEBA and the wage subsidy, we’re helping employers across the country keep Canadians on the job. Now, even though we’re reaching millions of Canadians, we need to reach even more. We’re working around the clock to update and adjust, so that help gets to as many workers, small businesses, families, and young people as possible. We also know that some sectors have been hit especially hard. So we’re stepping up on that, too. Minister Bains will be leading a new Industry Strategy Council. Chaired by Monique Leroux, this Council will take a deeper dive into how the pandemic is affecting specific sectors, and how to best support them. We are leveraging expertise from the Economic Strategy Tables we set up in the first mandate, as well as looking to new industry leaders. This will be a dedicated forum for industry and government to come together on tackling the effects of COVID-19.   And it builds on what we’ve already done for workers in everything from energy to agriculture. On that note, Minister Guilbeault will have more details at noon about how our $500 million package for arts, culture, and amateur sport is now being rolled out to support workers in those sectors. This investment will help people access wage support, and help organizations access funding.   Our artists, creators, and young athletes inspire us, and help us feel connected even when we’re at home. They’re there for us, and we’re going to be there for them. No matter where you work, no matter who you are, these are tough times. But with the right plan, we will get through this. And we’ll come back stronger than ever. It’s hard to think of tougher times for our country. But as our elders remind us, Canada has faced challenges before. And we’ve always overcome them. Today, we mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and the end of the Second World War on the continent. After six years of war it must have felt like that day would never come. But it did. And it came because of the courage of all who served, and because of the sacrifice of all who gave their lives. It has been 75 years since our grandparents and great-grandparents stood up to do their part. 75 years since they stood united and strong to ensure that we would live in peace and freedom. Today, as our generation faces our own battle, let us be inspired by them and their valour as we protect them, and all Canadians. This is our challenge, and I know we will rise to meet it. Thank you."

Over the last two months, Canadians have stepped up to keep each other safe. And because of those actions and those choices, in many parts of the country, we’re getting this virus under control. Now, that doesn’t mean we can let down our guard. But what our progress does mean is that where it’s safe to do so, we can gradually and carefully restart some of our activities. For many small business owners and their workers, being able to reopen is welcome news. Of course, this is not without its challenges. People need help getting back on their feet. That’s why we brought in new, targeted support to get businesses going again.    Use the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire your workers. Access a loan through the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) to adapt to new realities. And contact your Regional Development Agency, where we’ve boosted funding, if you don’t qualify for other supports. Thousands of business owners have already navigated the process and are getting the help they need. And if you’re not one of them yet, we’re making it simpler to find out what’s available. Go to the COVID-19 page at canada.ca. You’ll find a section that lays out all the programs based on what your need is, from rehiring staff to accessing credit. Your business matters—to your employees and to our country. In fact, it matters to our whole economy. So, a concern for you, is a concern for us too. And that brings me to the question of your rent. Paying rent on your space might be a problem right now. We hear that, so we’re taking action. We’ve created the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses program. This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords, so that they can reduce by 75 per cent the rent of small business tenants that have lost the majority of their revenues because of COVID-19. If you’re a landlord, and you and your tenant are eligible, please apply. Go to cmhc.ca to get the details on what information you’ll need when the application portal opens starting May 25. Once this launches, you’ll receive your relief quickly. Our government, along with the provinces and territories, will cover 50 per cent of the rent. We’re asking that landlords absorb 25 per cent, and tenants pay the rest with the support of programs like the CEBA. For larger retailers, we’re also working on a new support, and we’ll have more details to share soon. These are challenging times. But together, we can protect jobs and make sure that our economy bounces back. And that will be good for everyone.  Whether you work at the restaurant around the corner or at an office downtown, your job is how you support yourself and your family. And no matter what you do, no matter how many other people your workplace employs, we need to protect that. In addition to our support for small businesses, we’ve also brought in help for companies of every size. Last week, we launched the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility to provide bridge loans for the country’s largest employers. As of today, applications for this financing are open. These loans will be delivered through the Canada Development Investment Corporation, in cooperation with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and the Department of Finance. Our priority is that this program be fair and effective. Loans will be designed with a clear goal: protecting jobs and helping our economy rebound. Businesses can go online to cdev.gc.ca for more information on the application process. But I want to be clear. We are not offering companies a bailout. We are making loans available so that they can weather this storm and continue to employ millions of hardworking Canadians. No matter who you are or where you live, we’re here to support you. So, I want to end this morning by reminding parents that when you receive your Canada Child Benefit payment today, it will include an extra $300 per child. This is money to help you through this very tough time. So I want to say this to parents. It’s really hard to raise kids these days. But you are doing an excellent job, despite all the challenges, all the problems we are facing together as a society. Parents are doing an extraordinary job every day. Keep it up. We’ll be here for you. And we will get through this, together. Thank you.  "

Over the past few weeks, members of the Canadian Armed Forces have been helping out in long-term care facilities and seniors’ residences in Quebec and Ontario. Ontario and Quebec have asked us to extend the Army’s mission and, as I said yesterday, our government is currently discussing it with them. Our members are doing an extraordinary job helping our grandparents, parents, and seniors during this crisis, and I thank them very much. It is certainly not an easy job or an easy situation. This morning, the Government of Quebec released the Canadian Forces members’ report outlining a number of concerning issues. Several of the issues in the report—like the lack of staff—were among the reasons why Premier Legault requested the Army’s assistance a month and a half ago. There are serious concerns that had to be brought to Quebec’s attention and we sent the province the report last night. I also spoke with Premier Legault earlier this morning and I reiterated our support. Tomorrow, I plan on raising what’s happening in nursing homes and long-term care facilities with the premiers during our weekly call. I will once again offer our government’s support as they try to get the situation under control. As I’ve said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for seniors. They raised us. They built this country. They deserve better. During the first few weeks of the crisis, people’s lives were turned upside down. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost their job through no fault of their own—without warning—because of this pandemic. It put enormous financial pressure on everyone, from students to young professionals to families. So, we brought in the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to support people until they’re able to get back to work. And to help as many Canadians as possible keep their jobs or get hired, we introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. We also unveiled our $9-billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months. We now have over 45,000 jobs available for young people. If you or someone you know is interested, go to jobbank.gc.ca to apply. Now, as provinces and territories restart some activities and many people head back to work, fewer people will need the help of the CERB. But the wage subsidy will continue to be there to support Canadians, and make sure they can get paid their salaries. Maintaining the connection between employer and employee is key not just to helping people get back on their feet, but to keeping our economy strong. That’s why it’s so important that employers take advantage of this program and rehire workers. If you are an employer or a business owner but have not yet applied, I encourage you to visit the Canada Revenue Agency website to do so.  As I have said since the beginning, to get through this crisis, everyone has to do their part. To save lives, people have to continue practising physical distancing. To restart the economy, people need to work, and merchants and businesses need to have customers. So, if you’re an employer, rehire your employees. Our government can and will help you."
"12","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/06/04/prime-ministers-remarks-support-seniors-and-new-modelling-covid-19","Prime Minister’s remarks on support for seniors and new modelling on COVID-19",2020-06-04,"Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, Canada took part in a replenishment conference for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which was hosted by the United Kingdom. GAVI does incredibly important work around the globe, delivering vaccines to some of the world’s most vulnerable. They’ve also been helping developing countries to respond to outbreaks like COVID-19. GAVI saves lives, and Canada is doing its part. Now, I want to turn to what is happening later today. This afternoon, we’ll be releasing new modelling on COVID-19 in Canada. We’ll have more details then, but for now I want to talk about the main takeaways for these projections. The data shows that we are continuing to make progress in the fight against this virus. In many communities, the number of new cases is low, and we can trace where they came from. That’s an encouraging sign that the virus is slowing, and in some places, even stopping. But I want to be very clear: We are not out of the woods. The pandemic is still threatening the health and safety of Canadians. Across the country, and especially in areas where we continue to see large numbers of new cases, as well as in places like long-term care facilities and seniors’ homes, the situation remains serious. So, while we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures like testing and contact tracing. And as people head back to work, it’s even more important that we keep a two-metre distance from others, wash our hands, and wear a mask where physical distancing is not always possible. This is key to keeping us safe and keeping the situation under control. Otherwise, we risk losing the progress we have made, and above all, we must continue to protect our seniors. Even as we start to reopen parts of the economy, our parents and grandparents will have to stay home as much as possible. The confinement is having an impact on their mental health, their personal finances, and their quality of life. When this crisis first started, our seniors could count on a strong public pension system for steady income. The Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement were our first line of defence. But over time, this pandemic has made life more expensive. Seniors haven’t been able to take public transit. They haven’t been able to go to a store or shop the sales because of the virus. Instead, they’ve had to rely on deliveries to get the things they need – and it adds up.  And what makes things even harder is the fact that this is the new normal for many of them, at least for a little while. Even as we start to reopen parts of the economy, many seniors will have to stay home for longer to protect their health. And that’s really weighing on them. So, our government stepped up to help them weather this storm and help seniors with their daily expenses. In April, more than four million low-income seniors received a GST Credit top-up—worth an average of $375 for people who are single and $510 for couples—automatically in their bank accounts. This was a first step. We also announced that people receiving Old Age Security would get an extra $300 to offset some of the extra costs they’ve had to cover because of the virus. And to give even more support to low-income seniors, we said that seniors on the Guaranteed Income Supplement would get an additional $200. That means if you are one of the 2.2 million elders receiving both OAS and GIS, you will get an additional $500 to help you with everyday expenses. And today, I can confirm that you will be getting that money the week of July 6. This COVID crisis is tough on seniors and that’s why these additional funds will make a difference, with up to $900 for single seniors and up to $1500 for couples. At the same time, we are supporting programs and organizations that are helping improve seniors’ quality of life. For example, we are investing in the New Horizons program to allow affiliated organizations to adapt their services to the realities of the pandemic and help people stay in contact with their families. We are also providing funding to partners like the United Way, Community Foundations Canada, and the Red Cross, to combat food insecurity and provide more services to vulnerable seniors. So while we look toward recovery, we must remember that we are not all in the same situation. Many people, including seniors, will need to remain vigilant and follow specific instructions to protect their health. And our government will be there to support them. Later this evening, I will be speaking with the premiers and territorial leaders during our weekly teleconference. We will continue the conversation we started last week on safely reopening the economy, including on the funding announced for municipalities earlier this week. Again, thank you for being with us."

This morning, I am at the Biscotti & Cie café and restaurant in Chelsea, in the Outaouais region. A few moments ago, I had the chance to speak with the owner, Manuela, about the challenges she is facing because of the pandemic. In addition to Biscotti & Cie, Manuela also heads the Chelsea Pub and the Lofts du Village, a hotel project opening later this year. Restaurants and tourism are obviously two of the sectors that have been hardest hit by the crisis. And, like a lot of entrepreneurs across the country, Manuela had to slow down her business and make a number of changes to continue serving her customers. At Biscotti & Cie, they changed their menu to make it easier to order take-out and put new protocols in place to protect their customers and employees. But buying personal protective equipment and making delivery arrangements, on top of buying food, and paying bills and employees—it’s expensive. All across the country, a lot of people are experiencing the same thing. Business was going well and then, all of a sudden, the pandemic forced businesses and restaurants to close. Entrepreneurs had to delay or even cancel their plans and projects. Our government understands how difficult this situation is, so we have created a number of programs to help people get through this crisis. For example, Manuela used the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to rehire close to 75 employees. And with the reopening of the Chelsea Pub’s patio and dining room, she thinks she may be able to rehire even more people. Manuela is also benefitting from a rent reduction thanks to the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance. Small business owners create jobs, fuel the growth of our economy, and enrich our communities.  And our government is here for them when they need help the most. As we start to reopen parts of the economy, our government will continue to be there to help Canadians get back on their feet. And we’re making progress every day. In April, we announced a $9-billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the crisis. An important part of this plan was to create jobs for young people in sectors that need an extra hand and today, I have some good news to share. We’re creating 500 green jobs and training opportunities for young people in STEM in the energy, forestry, mining, earth sciences, and clean technology sectors. Ranging from six months to a year in length, these internships will give young people invaluable work experience and the chance to explore careers in the natural resource sector. As life starts getting back to normal, Canadians can count on our government to continue working with the provinces and territories to bring in the right measures to keep Canadians safe and healthy, and reopen the economy safely.  Last night, the First Ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I held our 14th weekly call. We talked about the Government’s proposal to provide $14 billion to address critical needs across the country over the coming six to eight months. This is money that could be used to offer more childcare spaces, increase testing and contact tracing, and keep people safe on the job. We want to work with the provinces and territories to implement these measures as soon as possible and make sure we don’t lose the progress we’ve made. We also talked about the upcoming launch of a new nationwide mobile app to provide notifications of exposure to COVID-19. As I mentioned yesterday, we will soon begin testing the app in Ontario, but it will be available to everyone across the country in the coming weeks. I want to end today by reminding everyone that Sunday is Father’s Day. This is always a special time to get together with family and enjoy the warm weather – two things we’ve been missing over the past few months. All provinces and territories have started loosening some restrictions that probably make it easier to celebrate with dad this weekend. As you start making plans, please be sure to follow the public health guidelines for your region. This is the best way to keep you, your dad, and the whole family safe, and have a great time on Sunday. And to all the dads out there – happy Father’s Day!"

Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been focused on keeping Canadians safe and making sure people are supported during this challenging time. And as we move into the summer, this work continues. While we’ve made good progress over the past few months, the virus remains a very serious threat to our health. And with parts of the economy shut down for many months, a lot of people need help getting back on their feet. So, we’re going to continue helping in every way we can. Our government has launched new programs and made new investments to help businesses reopen safely, get people back on the job, and lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back. If you own a business and you’re struggling with cash flow, you can get a loan through the Canada Emergency Business Account to bridge to better times. If you’re a student or a recent grad looking for a job, we’ve created thousands of new work placements through Canada Summer Jobs and the Student Work Placement Program. And if you’re an employer and you need help to bring back your staff, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy is there for you through this summer. In every part of the country, business owners are stepping up and hiring back their staff, from Brooks Signs in Brantford, Ontario to Anchor D Guiding & Outfitting in Turner Valley, Alberta. And moving forward, our government will help even more businesses bring back their workers. Over the past few weeks, life has slowly started returning to normal, and that’s good news for all of us. But with it also comes new challenges. Our government continues to follow the situation closely and listen to Canadians. People want programs that respond to their needs and realities. The federal government intends to extend the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance by another month and we’re working with the provinces and territories to do just that.  This program is helping thousands of small businesses across the country save on rent. We know that many business owners are struggling with cash flow right now, so we’re working on a solution. With summer officially here, I know a lot of people are wondering what to expect for the coming months. So, this afternoon, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo will release the latest public health modelling. We’ll have more details then, but here’s the main takeaway from these projections. After a very challenging spring, things are continuing to move in the right direction. We still have some hot spots in some parts of the country, but nationally, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is declining over time. And that’s because Canadians are doing their part. You took this seriously. You followed public health instructions, and made sacrifices, so we could get this virus under control. Over the coming weeks, we’re going to keep regularly updating Canadians on how this virus is progressing, as we have since the beginning of this crisis, including with the latest numbers continuing to be published every single day. As we move into this new phase however, Dr. Tam, Dr. Njoo, and I will provide an update on the pandemic a few times a week, instead of every day, when we have briefings or information to share. I want to stress though, that while we’re on the right track, the fight against COVID-19 is not over yet. As we start to reopen parts of the economy, we must continue to follow local public health guidelines to keep each other safe. With Canada Day right around the corner, we have another busy week ahead of us. In addition to our ongoing response to COVID-19, the new NAFTA will come into force on Wednesday. With trade between NAFTA members valued at nearly $1.5 trillion in 2018, we can’t overstate how vital it is to maintain free and fair trade between our three countries. Millions of jobs depend on a strong and stable relationship with our partners. This deal secures access to the North American market for our business owners, entrepreneurs, and consumers. It removes uncertainty for our manufacturers, our investors, and our workers. This deal is good for Canada and good for Canadians."

From the outset, our government has worked closely with the provinces and territories to support Canadians during the pandemic. Fighting COVID-19 has always been a Team Canada effort and it continues to be as we move into the recovery phase. We’ve been working with our provincial and territorial partners to outline what needs to be done over the next six to eight months to safely restart our economy. And today, I have some good news to share. Our government will invest over $19 billion to ensure the provinces and territories have the support they need to protect the health of Canadians, help people get back to work safely, and prepare for a potential second wave.  As part of this agreement, we’ve outlined seven priority areas on which to focus our efforts, like increased testing and contact tracing, securing more personal protective equipment, and more support for the most vulnerable, including for seniors in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. But COVID-19 isn’t just a health crisis. It’s an economic crisis, too. So when we talk about the recovery phase, it’s not just about making sure we can detect, control, and prevent future outbreaks. It’s also about helping people, businesses, and entire communities adjust to our new normal, because until we find a vaccine, the daily threat of COVID-19 will not disappear. In addition to buying more PPE so workers can follow public health guidelines at the office, we also have to make sure that people can get to work safely, that children are looked after, and that those who can’t find work right away are supported. So, making sure there are enough safe childcare spaces available or supporting people who don’t have paid sick leave – those must be top priorities, too. This agreement also includes more support for municipalities. Our towns and cities have been at the forefront of responding to COVID-19 since the beginning. Cities must remain up and running if our economy is to eventually get back up and running. If cities aren’t equipped for a safe restart, people will not be safe. That’s why today’s agreement provides municipalities with funding to cover operational costs. We’re also going to give more support for transit specifically. If we want people to participate in the economy, they need to be able to get to work safely. No one should have to turn down a job because they don’t want to risk their health during a crowded commute. Investments in municipalities and in transit will be shared evenly between the federal and provincial governments. As we prepare our economic recovery, all orders of government know we have to keep working together to keep people safe. Canadians can count on us. On that note, I want to thank Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, the Premiers, and officials who have worked hard to support Canadians and lay the groundwork for our economic recovery with this agreement. I want to close this press conference with some news regarding the Canada-U.S. border. Once again, Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current border measures by one month, until August 21. And we’re going to keep working closely with our American neighbours to keep people safe on both sides of the border. Tomorrow, Minister Morneau will announce more details about the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. We will also have more to say about how we plan to provide more support for people with disabilities. We have already shared the bill with the opposition parties, so we will have more news on that. Once again, thank you for joining us."

It’s great to be here today at Yorkwoods Public School with Minister Hussen, and Members of Parliament Kirsty Duncan and Judy Sgro. We’re also joined by Carlene Jackson and Alexander Brown from the TDSB, as well as School Trustee Chris Mammoliti. And to Principal Verma and Vice-Principal MacDonald – thank you for welcoming us here this morning. I know the end of August is always busy as you get ready to welcome kids back. And while every year is different, this September will be unlike any you’ve had to deal with before. Parents and staff are anxious about what the school year may hold. As a dad, and as a former teacher, I get that. We all want what’s best for our kids, including a good education. School matters – I got to see that first hand when I was in front of the classroom. And that’s why the tools we give to young people now to keep them safe, to allow them to be successful in the years to come in a world that is changing, a world that right now is more changed and more transformed than we’ve seen in a long time, getting them back to school safely and making sure them and their parents are confident about what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, really, really matters. Just a few minutes ago, I had the chance to sit down with Joanne Luong and Phong Bui. They have four kids, and they were telling me that they’re worried about sending them back to school. Like every parent, Joanne and Phong want to make sure their children are safe. But as owners of their own business, it’s also hard to juggle work with the kids at home. This is something that a lot of parents – especially mothers – are facing right now. Our children must be safe in the classroom. That’s non-negotiable. No parent should be losing sleep because they have to go back to work, but aren’t confident schools are properly prepared.  My colleagues, the Premiers, are responsible for ensuring that our children are safe in their classrooms and that the teachers are safe on the job. But our government will be there to help them. As I have said before, the provinces and territories must make decisions based on public health advice, not budget limitations. We have put our words into action and are providing federal funding to help them.  Our government has already committed to investing an unprecedented $19 billion in the Safe Restart Agreement with the provinces and territories. We’re doing this so we can give Canadians the support they need. We’ve always promised to be there for Canadians, and that is exactly what we’re doing. But, of course, there is still work to be done. So today, we’re taking another step forward. Yesterday, I spoke with Premiers about the upcoming school year. They’re working hard to protect our kids. But this year is challenging and like no other. That’s why today, I can announce that the federal government is investing up to $2 billion in school safety for the coming year. This money, which will flow through the new Safe Return to Class Fund, will help keep students and teachers safe as schools reopen. Our children must always be our top priority – as parents and as governments. Once people know their kids are safe, they can get back to work with less worries. Education is, of course, a provincial jurisdiction, and I told the Premiers yesterday that we absolutely respect that. What we’re announcing today is designed to support provinces and territories in the best way possible. Our government is here to help. We’ve made this funding flexible, so provinces, and ultimately schools, can use it for what they need most, from hand sanitizer to remote learning. Over the next few weeks, we will work hand in hand with the provinces and territories to ensure that the funds flow as quickly as possible. On top of this new funding, we’re also investing $112 million in schools in First Nations communities. This money will help those communities safely open their schools with proper supports for students, parents, and educators. I want to thank everyone who has helped bring this new Safe Return to Class Fund together. Over the past week, I’ve heard clearly from MPs across the country, as well as directly from concerned parents, asking us to see just what the federal government can do to help keep our kids safe. So, in his very first days as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister LeBlanc and I talked about this, and he reached out to folks across the country.   And again, I want to thank members of caucus – including and especially Kirsty and Judy, here with us today – who have been a driving force to get more help to parents and kids. Also, yesterday when I sat down with Dr. Tam, back to school was one of a number of things that we talked about to prepare for the fall. Together, we came up with creative solutions for the Government of Canada to help our families and ensure our children are safe. School safety is top of mind for all of us right now. No matter where they live, students must be safe in their classrooms. Teachers and staff must be safe on the job. And parents must be confident that they can get back to work.  At our First Ministers’ Meeting yesterday afternoon, the Premiers and I discussed the measures we’re taking to keep Canadians safe in the weeks and months to come. That includes today’s federal support for schools, and progress on everything from personal protective equipment, to help for the most vulnerable. I would like to thank the Premiers for working together on several important projects over the past few months. Fighting COVID-19 is a Team Canada effort, and we’re all committed to continuing this work together into the fall. Thanks to everyone for being here today."
"17","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/09/23/prime-ministers-remarks-addressing-canadians-covid-19-situation","Prime Minister’s remarks addressing Canadians on the COVID-19 situation",2020-09-23,"Hello everyone. My fellow Canadians, good evening. In the West, good afternoon. I want to speak directly to you today because Canada is at a crossroads.  I know that the fight against COVID-19 has been difficult for all Canadians over the past six months. For too many people, it’s a matter of life and death. And for all of us, collectively, it’s the fight of our generation.  In the spring, we all worked together to flatten the curve, and our efforts paid off. But now, the virus is coming back in full force in several parts of the country. In our four biggest provinces, the second wave isn’t just starting – it’s already underway. The numbers are clear. Back on March 13 when we went into lockdown, there were 47 new cases of COVID-19. Yesterday alone, we had well over 1,000. We’re on the brink of a fall that could be much worse than the spring.   I know this isn’t the news that any of us wanted to hear. And we can’t change today’s numbers or even tomorrow’s – those were already decided by what we did, or didn’t do, two weeks ago. But what we can change is where we are in October, and into the winter. It’s all too likely we won’t be gathering for Thanksgiving, but we still have a shot at Christmas. Together, we have the power to get this second wave under control. I know we can do it, because we’ve already done it once before. In the spring, we all did our part by staying home. And this fall, we have even more tools in the toolbox. People are wearing masks. That’s critical, so keep it up. We’ve got the COVID Alert app. Take the teacher who felt fine, but who tested positive after the app warned her she’d been exposed. COVID Alert meant she went home instead of the classroom.  It’s a powerful, free tool that’s easy to use and protects your privacy. So if you haven’t already, download it off the App Store or Google Play Store. It’s one more way to keep ourselves and others safe. Another is to get your flu shot this fall. The steps we’re taking today will make all the difference in what will happen in two weeks and in two months. Wear a mask – it saves lives. Wash your hands. Keep your distance. Get your flu shot. Listen to public health agencies. As Dr. Tam said yesterday, limit your social circle. Avoid taking unnecessary risks. This is not the time to have parties. No one is invincible. Your loved ones aren’t invincible.  We cannot let our guard down, even in places where the number of cases is still low. And everybody, please, download the COVID Alert app. It is free and easy to use, it protects your privacy, and it will protect you and the people around you. This is the time for all of us, as Canadians, to do our part for our country, as the government does its part for you. There is a covenant between the government and the people that the government serves. You need to know that you can rely on us, just like you can rely on each other. As we face this crisis, as we get ready to rebuild, we will continue to be there for you. The government put forth a four-part plan to respond to this crisis. The first thing we have to do is to protect people’s health. The actions of our parents and grandparents – the generation that faced the Great Depression and the Second World War – remind us that we have to be resilient and patient in times of crisis. They built the world of today. Now it’s up to us to build the world of tomorrow, and we have to start by protecting them. The situation experienced by too many of our seniors in long-term care centres is unacceptable. It must change, and it will change. In the spring, we sent the Canadian Armed Forces to help, and the Canadian Red Cross is still on the ground. We will work immediately with the provinces and territories to establish new national standards for long-term care. Job one is keeping people safe. That’s why we’re signing deals on multiple potential vaccines, on therapeutics, on personal protective equipment (PPE). In fact, because we mobilized this spring, Canadians are now producing almost every type of PPE we need. We’re helping the provinces and territories ramp up their capacity on testing, while creating a federal response team for surge demand. And, as soon as there’s approval for faster tests to be used safely, we’ll get them out across the country. If you need a test, you should be able to get one, and get it quickly. This is about safety, and it’s about what’s right for Canadians. Protecting your health is the best thing we can do for the economy. So that’s what we’re working on first. And that brings me to the second part of the plan – supporting Canadians through this pandemic. The federal government will have your back, whatever it takes, to help you get through this crisis. Maybe you were one of the almost nine million people who used the Canada Emergency Response Benefit this spring. We will continue to support all those who need it with a strengthened and broadened Employment Insurance system. Maybe your boss was able to keep you on the job, or hire you back, because the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy helped with the payroll. People still need this program, so we’re extending it right through to next summer. Or perhaps you’re a business owner, needing extra help to bridge to better times. For you, among other measures, we’re expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account. And there’s a lot more we’re going to do. Go to Canada.ca/coronavirus to see what support is available right now, and how to apply. I know some people are asking how we can afford to do all this for Canadians. That’s fair. Low interest rates mean we can afford it. And in fact, doing less would end up costing far more. Doing less would mean a slower recovery and bigger deficits in the long run. While we’re dealing with this pandemic, I don’t want you – or your parent, or your friend – to take on debt that your government can better shoulder. So yes, in the short term, we’ll keep investing.   But beyond the emergency, as we start to build back better, we must do that in a fiscally sustainable way. Investing for our recovery must be done responsibly. You know, the pandemic is revealing the fundamental inequalities in our society, but now, we have the opportunity to take action to change that. We will build a better society for everyone, while at the same time making the economy better for everyone. This is the third part of the government’s approach. By creating a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system, we’ll ensure that kids have access to care, and that no parent – especially no mother – has to put their career on hold. This pandemic has reminded us all that building strong social supports is essential to growing the economy. By accelerating progress on national, universal pharmacare, we’ll get people the medicine they need, while alleviating pressure on the health care system. By investing to eliminate chronic homelessness, we will create healthier, more prosperous communities. Housing is not just a problem – it’s also a solution. It creates jobs. It enables people to grow and contribute.  We all want to build a stronger country for everyone. To do this, we must redouble our efforts to fight climate change. This is also the best way to ensure good jobs for today and for the future. Energy workers innovating to decarbonize. Auto workers building zero-emissions vehicles. Engineers and construction workers delivering green retrofits for our homes and buildings.  These are some of the people who will create a competitive economy of the future. As we do this work – protecting people’s health, supporting Canadians, building back better – we can’t forget what it’s all for: Making sure that everyone can participate to their full potential. And that’s the final part of the plan. As a country, we must keep making progress on reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, and on fighting systemic racism. Diversity is not just our strength, it’s our competitive edge. Our differences make us stronger, no matter the colour of our skin, our beliefs, our culture, or our language. In our country, we are proud to have two official languages – English and French – that we will continue to protect. In Canada, we know that we are stronger when we come together and when we help each other. We face challenges together.   That is what has helped us manage the crisis better than many others. This is not the first time our country has been called to stand united and strong. In the face of change, our Greatest Generation showed us that overcoming crisis isn’t easy. They didn’t give up. And neither can we. To parents feeling like you can’t get your life under control; To kids wondering why mom and dad can’t just fix this; To seniors feeling like there’s nothing you can do, and thinking about all the things you can’t do: That’s understandable. But can’t will not define us. We can bend the curve. We can build a stronger future. We can define the change. As Canadians, we are people who say, “I can”. In every sector, all across the country, every one of us is doing our part. The story of this pandemic is the story of people who are making sacrifices. It’s the story of people who work hard every day to be there for each other. This is especially the story of our front line workers – heroes, from coast to coast to coast, who have never hesitated, who have never backed down from this fight. You are an inspiration to us all. We are at a crossroads, and the future is in our hands. There are many days to go before we get to the other side of this. But there are also many of us to get us there, so long as we each remember to do our part. And I know that we will. We are Canadians.   And together, there’s nothing we can’t do. Take care of yourselves, my friends. Thank you."

I’m pleased to be here with Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo. I want to start today with an update on COVID-19. In the last few days, Ontario and Quebec have had their highest-ever numbers of cases. And across the country, totals have gone up, including in long-term care homes. That’s not where any of us wanted to be on the way into Thanksgiving. But even if we can’t gather this long weekend, we still have a chance to turn things around for Christmas. You’re probably already wearing a mask when you go out – now more than ever, keep it up. The same goes for staying two metres apart, and washing your hands. I know we keep saying it, but that’s because these small things can make a big difference. And if you haven’t already, download the COVID Alert app now, which is another way of keeping yourself and others safe. Seven provinces have brought the app fully online, and we’re expecting more news on this later today.  COVID Alert is free and protects your privacy, so download it from Google Play or the App Store. The more people who sign up, the more powerful this tool will become. Already in Ontario, over 600 people have registered a positive result, which automatically notified thousands of people they came into contact with. Now is the time for all of us to use the app. Our government's number one priority is people's safety. We have now procured more than two billion pieces of personal protection equipment for Canadians. Over the past month, our government has delivered tens of millions of items to the provinces and territories – from face shields to masks, gowns, and gloves. In terms of screening equipment such as swabs, not only have we supplied the provinces and territories, but we now have two Canadian companies that are authorized to supply swabs made right here in Canada with 3D printers. And last week, Health Canada received its first request for authorization for the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, to which we have secured access. This is another step towards ensuring that Canadians get a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible Our government will continue doing everything we can to support people through this crisis, whatever it takes, as long as it takes. Yesterday, I had a very productive call with Mayor Tory of Toronto, about addressing the challenges facing Canada’s largest city. Later today, I’ll be speaking with Mayor Watson from Ottawa, and Mayor Brown from Brampton. I will soon be speaking with Mayor Plante from Montréal, and I just spoke with Mayor Labeaume from Quebec City.   Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort, and we’re here for Canadians right across the country. We’ve created the COVID Testing Assistance Response Team, to quickly deploy across Canada because the federal government stands ready to help. Federal lab space is also providing surge support on processing of tests, including for Ontario for 1,000 tests a day. And additional federal labs will be added. On contact tracing, we have agreements in place with Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta, with more to come for other provinces and territories.  There are 500 full-time contact tracers provided for Ontario, including 30 tracers specifically for Ottawa. At the same time, we’re moving forward with programs that go directly to Canadians. As of this morning, applications for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit are open. These two programs are for Canadians not covered at work if they get COVID-19, or if their kids or parents get it and they have to take care of them. If you need this support, go to the CRA’s My Account through Canada.ca, or call 1-800-959-2019 or 1-800-959-2041. Next week, applications will also open for the Canada Recovery Benefit, to support people who are directly affected by COVID-19 but can’t access EI. These three new programs – the Recovery Benefit, the Sickness Benefit, and the Caregiving Benefit – are there for you. This fall is turning out to be pretty challenging for a lot of Canadians, including for young people. For students: I know this isn’t the Thanksgiving – let alone the year – you had hoped for. But even if things are different this long weekend, I hope you still take some time – probably online – with loved ones.  If you’re feeling overwhelmed or you’re struggling, reach out. You have a whole network – family, friends, teachers – that’s there for you. I know we’re going through really tough times right now – everyone is – but we need you, your strength, your resilience, your vision for the future. We will continue to be there for you. You got this. And on that note, I’d like to mention that it is World Teachers’ Day. As a dad, and someone who’s spent time at the front of a classroom, I know how important teaching can be. So to teachers and educators across the country: thank you for everything you do. Of course, even in regular times the job is not without its challenges. And right now, teachers are facing circumstances that none of us could have ever predicted. But despite everything, you are doing an incredible job. You are devoted every day and you are making a huge difference in the lives of our young people. Later today, we will be announcing the names of 71 exception educators from around the country who will be given the Prime Minister’s Award for Teaching Excellence. These are people who believe in our children and, as a result, are helping build a better future for us all. Not only are you navigating health rules and online learning, you’re guiding young people through an incredibly difficult and challenging new world. You’re there for our kids, and know that our government will be there for you. We created the $2 billion Safe Return to Class Fund, to keep you and your students safe. For Edmonton Public Schools, this money has helped with rapid testing to protect staff and students. For schools in London, Ontario, it has meant buying more PPE and hiring additional teachers. And right across the country, this investment is going towards keeping all of our classrooms healthy. As with the Safe Return to Class Fund, we will continue to find other ways to ensure the safety of all Canadians. Flattening the curve – whether in schools or workplaces – is our top priority in the coming weeks. And finally, I want to let Canadians know that I’ve asked the Foreign Minister to travel to Europe, to discuss with our allies the developments in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thank you very much."

It’s good to be here this morning to answer questions with the doctors, as usual, as well as Minister Duclos, Minister Anand, and Minister LeBlanc. Our lives have changed dramatically over the past few months. And for the young people who are still trying to find their place in the world, this change is particularly difficult. Earlier this week, I had a chance to speak to high school students at the Ottawa Catholic School Board’s Virtual Academy. We talked about what this pandemic has been like for them, their family, and their friends. And just like young people always do, they had a lot of great questions. One student, Laiya, asked how long it would be until we have a vaccine for COVID-19.  As I told Laiya, we’re coming at this from every angle, whether that’s investing in Canadian research or securing the world’s most promising candidate vaccines. Canadian expertise is one of our greatest assets in combatting this virus. That’s why, in April, we invested over $1 billion in Canada’s Plan to Mobilize Science to fight COVID‑19. As part of this plan, we invested in the Strategic Innovation Fund, which supports researchers across Canada in developing and manufacturing vaccines. This morning, I want to let Laiya and her class to know – along with everyone else who’s following this – that we’re taking yet another step forward. Today, I can announce that we are investing $214 million for made-in-Canada vaccines. To begin with, our government is providing up to $173 million for Medicago, to advance their vaccine candidate and create a production facility in Quebec City. We have also reached an agreement with them to supply up to 76 million doses of their vaccine. This is about securing potential vaccines for Canadians, while supporting good jobs in research. On that note, the second part of today’s investment is for the Vancouver-based biotech company, Precision NanoSystems. They’re also making progress with a vaccine candidate, so we’re allocating up to $18.2 million for their development and testing. The final piece of this made-in-Canada investment is over $23 million through the Industrial Research Assistance Program for earlier-stage vaccine candidates being developed across the country. From Dartmouth to Burnaby, Canadian researchers are doing great work and we’re here to support that.  Of course, it’s not just Canadian researchers who are working on vaccine options. Around the world, the best and the brightest are coming together to find a solution to this pandemic. Canada has direct agreements with a range of vaccine developers for their most promising candidates. And through our investment in GAVI’s COVAX Facility and Advance Market Commitment, we also have access to additional doses for Canadians as part of their international program. When a vaccine is ready, Canada will be too. While work keeps going to develop vaccines, we must continue to use the tools at our disposal to keep people safe. Our government is working tirelessly to help the provinces and territories increase their testing capacity. And today, I have good news to announce on that front as well. We have now received hundreds of thousands of the Abbott Panbio rapid tests, which are currently being distributed across the country. Two trucks of the other Abbott rapid test – ID NOW – have also arrived in Ontario, with more coming soon. In the weeks to come, we will continue to support the provinces and territories as we get tests out to the frontlines. I want to end today by talking about where we are with this pandemic, and where we need to go from here. Yesterday, Canada had 2,788 new cases of COVID-19. This is the highest-ever number of new cases of COVID-19. We have to get these numbers down. This is serious, and everybody must do their part. Your loved ones with pre-existing conditions, your parents, your grandparents – they’re counting on you. Our frontline workers, our nurses and doctors – they’re counting on you, too. People’s lives are at stake. We can’t afford to be careless or think that this virus will just go away on its own. So please keep following your local public health guidelines. Please wear a mask and keep your distance. And if you haven’t already, please join the 4.8 million Canadians who have downloaded the free COVID Alert app. In the spring, we flattened the curve once before, and I know that we can do it again this fall. We beat that first wave and saved lives. I know we can do it again. Thank you, everyone."

I want to begin by addressing the COVID-19 situation in Manitoba. The record numbers the province has seen over the last few days is really concerning. In light of this surge, we’re partnering with Manitoba First Nations to provide over $61 million in immediate funding to support their response. This funding will support public health measures, food security, and other surge capacity needs.   In addition, Indigenous Services Canada is mobilizing contact tracers and equipment to further help affected communities. Of course, Manitoba isn’t alone. Across the country, and around the world, we’re seeing rising numbers of COVID-19 cases. This was the main focus of my calls with President-elect Biden and Prime Minister Johnson yesterday.  With rising cases of COVID-19 here at home, there’s added pressure on all orders of government to keep people safe and to protect jobs.   But I would hope that no leader in our country is easing public health vigilance because they feel pressure not to shut down businesses or slow down our economy. I understand that worry, but let me tell you: that’s how we end up with businesses going out of business and the economy damaged even more. Beating COVID is the only way to protect our economy. Yes, we have great news of possible vaccines on the horizon. But a vaccine later won’t help you or your family if you get sick now. The federal government is here to help your communities.  We are providing unprecedented direct support to those businesses impacted by any shutdown orders. We are there for workers who lose hours. Who lose their job. It’s tough, but I know we can get through this. In recent days, Canada posted a record number of cases and we are very concerned about the situation. So I urge the Premiers and the Mayors to please do the right thing: act now to protect public health. If you think something is missing in the support we’re offering your citizens – tell us. We will work with you, as we have since day one.  This federal government promised to have Canadians’ backs. And we will. Whatever it takes, for as long it takes. The virus is spreading quickly and that is why we must continue our efforts. So once again, I am asking all Canadians to please follow your local public health guidelines:  Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Keep a safe two-metre distance from each other. And download the COVID Alert app. Together, we will get through this.  Job one right now is keeping people safe. So whether it’s by buying more PPE or helping to ramp up testing, that’s what our government is focused on. Over the past few days, we’ve provided over 1.2 million pairs of nitrile gloves to workers on the front lines, with millions more to come. We’ve also provided over 3.3 million rapid tests to the provinces and territories, with more on the way. And to ensure that we have as many resources as possible, Health Canada approved another rapid test, the BD Veritor. This is a handheld device that can process a test in just over 15 minutes. Canada has a contract for 7.6 million of these tests overall, with millions arriving before the end of this year. We expect delivery to start in the next few weeks. Finding a safe, effective vaccine is vital to stop the spread of COVID-19. That’s why we’ve secured millions of doses of potential vaccines from the world’s leading vaccine manufacturers and therapeutics. Right now, scientists and companies are working around the clock, and just yesterday, we heard promising news from Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidate. Canada signed a deal to secure millions of these doses back in August, adding to our diverse portfolio of potential vaccines and therapeutics. We will continue to support researchers and scientists in the weeks and months to come. And when a vaccine is approved, we will be ready. Since the start of this pandemic, we’ve seen Canadian companies step up to make personal protective equipment. And as a part of our Made in Canada plan, we’ve been supporting businesses like General Motors in Oshawa to do just that. So far, they’ve made nearly five million masks for people right here at home. These are masks made by Canadians, for Canadians. And the production of these essential pieces of PPE are creating good jobs.  On that note, the newly ratified agreement between GM and Unifor is great news for workers and for our auto industry in Canada. I spoke with Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, yesterday and we’re both excited about what our future collaboration could bring. This agreement brings up to 1,700 new, good-paying jobs in Oshawa, while securing jobs in St. Catharines and Woodstock. This is a vote of confidence by industry leaders in Canada’s economy.  Our government will continue to work with our partners to ensure that Canadians get good jobs they can rely on.    I want to end this morning by taking a moment to recognize that tomorrow, we will mark Remembrance Day. Canadians would normally gather at cenotaphs across the country to pay tribute to those who fought for our freedom. People would gather at local Royal Canadian Legions, to thank the heroes who kept this country strong and free. But this year will be different. COVID-19 means many ceremonies are online. Many veterans are staying at home. And too many of the Legions that provide support for them are facing tough times themselves. Our veterans served Canada with honour and valour. They stepped up for us, and now, we must step up for them. So today, I can announce that the Government of Canada is providing $20 million to create the new Veterans Organizations Emergency Support Fund. This fund is designed to help veterans’ organizations keep providing services to support those affected by the crisis. Over $17 million of the funding will go to the Royal Canadian Legion, ANAVETS, True Patriot Love, and VETS Canada. The remaining amount is available – through application – to other veterans’ organizations that have been affected by COVID-19. Minister MacAulay will have more to share on this in a few minutes.   But to the women and men who have served our country, I want to say this – you represent the best of who we are, and we will forever be in your debt. And to all those who bravely serve today – thank you for everything you do. This week, even if we cannot get together as we usually do, we can still show support for our veterans by wearing a poppy and watching Remembrance Day ceremonies online. I encourage Canadians to search for the hashtag #CanadaRemembers on social media to read stories of service and sacrifice by our brave men and women in uniform.  On this Remembrance Day, let’s pay tribute to our veterans who have given so much and to our military personnel who continue to be there for us. Thank you."

Over the weekend, we’ve seen Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Alberta all report new single-day highs of COVID-19. Just yesterday, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador left the Atlantic bubble, as cases increase on the East Coast.     And a few days ago, our government approved a request for assistance to deploy in a long-term care home in the Opaskwayak Cree Nation in Manitoba.  As they always do, our brave women and men in uniform are stepping up again to support Canadians and help provinces get the situation under control. The cases we are seeing are extremely concerning, and the federal government will continue to be there—for people and small businesses—every step of the way. As of yesterday, applications opened for the newly launched Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy. If you own a small business, you could get up to 65 per cent of your business’s rent covered. This goes directly to you and not through your landlord.   If your community is in lockdown, we’re adding an extra 25 per cent of help for commercial rent through the new Lockdown Support. Combined with the rent subsidy, you could have up to 90 per cent of your rent covered. To help with another big expense for business—payroll—the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy has also been extended until June of next year. These programs are just some of the many measures we’ve introduced to have the backs of business owners and workers alike through this second wave. Go to Canada.ca/coronavirus to find out what supports are there for you. We knew that this second wave had the potential to get really serious, really fast. And we also knew that we had to be ready to do whatever it takes to get it under control. Because at the end of the day, lives are at stake. I know you get that. I know you’re worried about the people around you. Last Tuesday, I got an email from Jacquie in Edmonton. Jacquie is worried about her husband who works in the school system. She’s worried about her grandparents and parents-in-law who are in long-term care homes. She’s worried about her kids. Jacquie, I hear you. You’re right—this is a tough time. I want you to know that you’re not in this alone. Our government’s top priority is to keep Canadians safe. That’s why, every step of the way, we’ve been supporting the provinces and territories so that they can make the right decisions for you. Our supports for businesses and for people mean that local officials don’t have to choose between people’s health and the economy.   And we’ve been supporting with supplies as well. As of last week, we’ve sent over 300,000 rapid tests to Alberta, and 444,000 face masks. The federal government has also provided $1.3 billion to the province for everything from personal protective equipment (PPE) to contact tracers through the Safe Restart Agreement, with another $260 million for schools in Alberta through the Safe Return to Class Fund. And that’s just some of the support we’ve made available for people and businesses in Alberta, just like for everyone across the country. No matter where you live, we will continue to be there for you through this second wave, and beyond. Whether that means buying more PPE, increasing testing, or investing in research, that is what we work on.   Since last week, we have provided more than 2.9 million pairs of nitrile gloves to the provinces and territories, and more are coming. We have also sent them 4.6 million rapid tests, and millions more are coming. People need this essential help on the ground. We will continue to do our part and to provide them with the equipment they need over the weeks and months to come. It is essential that we purchase and distribute protective equipment and rapid tests, but it’s also important to find a safe and effective vaccine if we want to beat COVID-19. Just yesterday, we heard promising news about the candidate vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Canada already has an agreement to receive up to 20 million doses. This vaccine is one of a range of potential vaccines for Canadians. And when we have a vaccine, we will need the right equipment to administer it. To date, we have received over 24 million syringes and needles, and more deliveries will be arriving every week. This is part of the strategy we have put in place so we are ready when the vaccine is ready. We know that not everyone will be vaccinated at the same time. We will have to determine priorities. But everything we are doing now will help us vaccinate Canadians as quickly as possible. To keep Canadians safe, we need access to as many potential vaccines and treatments as possible. Today, I can announce that we’ve signed a deal to secure up to 26,000 doses of a therapeutic drug from Eli Lilly, with options for thousands more. This treatment was developed in partnership with Vancouver’s AbCellera Biologics, and is part of our support for researchers right here at home who are working around the clock to find a treatment for COVID-19. We will continue to support our scientists and our researchers, who will stop at nothing to find a safe and effective treatment for this virus. So to the scientists and researchers across the country: Thank you for everything you do. Just like always, your dedication and expertise are making Canadians heathier and safer, and are building a better tomorrow.  Canada is lucky to have thousands of world-class scientists and researchers. As a government, we will continue to be here every step of the way to support you in the work you do. The news about promising vaccine candidates that we’ve heard in the past few days is reason to be hopeful. Our government has worked hard to secure tens of millions of doses, so we’re prepared once a safe, effective vaccine is ready for Canadians. But we cannot be complacent now.  Remember, if you catch COVID-19 this week, a vaccine in the coming months won’t help you. We’ve seen restrictions increase across the country over the past few days, and Canadians are taking extra care to stay home. But I want to remind you—nothing that we do today will bring the numbers down this week. This week’s numbers were already determined by behaviours last week and the week before. What we can affect today is what our country looks like a week, two weeks from now. So continue doing your part to keep yourself, your family, and your loved ones safe. Stay at home. Wear a mask. Avoid social gatherings, especially indoors. And don’t forget to download the COVID Alert app. It’s easy, free, and quick. And it’s incredibly powerful. Just ask Sasha from Toronto. Sasha downloaded the app and, two weeks ago, it notified him that he’d been exposed to someone who had tested positive for COVID-19.  Sasha always wears his mask, sanitizes everything, and felt just fine. But he did the right thing, and went in to get tested. Well, the test came back positive. He’d been asymptomatic the whole time. If Sasha hadn’t had COVID Alert, he would never have known. But because of the app he found out, and then was able self-isolate to keep other people safe. He and his family are almost done their self-isolation, and they’ve said that they want everyone to know about their story so that as many people as possible use the COVID Alert app. To Sasha and his wife Kate: Thank you for doing the right thing by getting the app, getting tested, and then staying home.  And thank you for sharing your story to encourage even more people to make the smart, responsible choice that you did. The more people download this app, the stronger it becomes. So join the over 5.4 million Canadians who—like Sasha—have downloaded the COVID Alert app. Yesterday, I spoke with students and teachers at St. Martha Catholic School in Kingston, Ontario, along with local Member of Parliament Mark Gerretsen. So I would like to end today by directly addressing the teachers and support staff who are helping us to educate our children during this difficult time: I know that this year has been hard. I know that you will continue doing everything you can to help our children, to raise our children, to teach our children. But it’s really not easy. You are putting yourselves at risk, you are going above and beyond to support our children and their parents. Thank you. I know the commitment it takes to be a teacher. I know what you are doing as teachers and I can assure you that all Canadians are immensely grateful. Keep up the excellent work. Keep being there for us, as we will continue to be there for you. Thank you."
"22","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/12/07/prime-ministers-remarks-announcing-early-delivery-pfizer-biontech-covid-19","Prime Minister’s remarks announcing the early delivery of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine",2020-12-07,"Good morning everyone. I am very pleased to be here with Minister Anand, Dr. Njoo, and Major-General Fortin. This morning, I have important news to share on vaccines. From day one of this crisis, our government’s top priority has been protecting people around the country. Since March, we’ve procured billions of pieces of personal protective equipment and secured millions of rapid tests, which we have sent to the provinces and territories to get to the front lines. We’ve also provided tens of billions of dollars to the provinces and territories for health care, essential workers, and school safety. We’re using every tool in the toolbox to keep people safe and get Canada through the storm. It’s been a difficult year, and we’re not out of this crisis yet. But now, vaccines are coming. Our goal is to provide a safe and effective vaccine to Canadians as soon as possible. At the last meeting with First Ministers, Minister LeBlanc spoke of the need to work together with the provinces and territories, and Indigenous communities to ensure the rollout of the vaccine. A week and a half ago, we also announced that a National Operations Centre had been established through the Public Health Agency of Canada, supported by the Canadian Armed Forces. Major-General Fortin is leading the coordination and logistics, and I know he has the expertise we need. We are facing the largest immunization in the history of our country. This is no small task, which is why we have a clear plan. Our government – through the National Operations Centre – has been working with the provinces and territories to ensure that we’re ready to roll out vaccine doses as soon as they’re approved and delivered. On procurement of these vaccines, Minister Anand and her team have been working tirelessly to secure the most diverse portfolio of vaccines in the world. And today, we see those efforts paying off.   Canada has secured an agreement with Pfizer to begin early delivery of doses of their vaccine candidate. We are now contracted to receive up to 249,000 of our initial doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine in the month of December. Pending Health Canada approval, the first shipment of doses is tracking for delivery next week. Shipments will continue to arrive into 2021, with millions of doses on the way. This will move us forward on our whole timeline of vaccine rollout, and is a positive development in getting Canadians protected as soon as possible. Pfizer, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the provinces and territories, are working together to finalize preparations at the first 14 vaccination sites this week. I want to assure Canadians that any vaccine approved in Canada will be safe and effective. The regulatory process is ongoing and experts are working around the clock. They will uphold Canada’s globally recognized gold standard for medical approvals. We also have agreements with six other vaccine candidates, making our range of potential vaccines the broadest and most diverse in the world. In addition to Pfizer-BioNTech, there are also Moderna, AstraZeneca-Oxford, and Johnson & Johnson who have already submitted their vaccine candidates to Health Canada. We are working hard to ensure that Canadians have access to a safe and secure vaccine as soon as possible, as soon as the doses are ready. While vaccines are on the horizon, remember, they cannot protect you if you get COVID-19 now. I know this winter will be hard, especially with the holidays fast approaching. But we are coming into the final miles of this crisis. So let’s all buckle down and do what’s necessary to keep ourselves and others safe. Over the last few days, we’ve seen new records of COVID-19 cases in a number of provinces. Hospitalizations are rising, families are losing people, and our most vulnerable are at risk. Just because we’re getting closer to vaccines doesn’t mean we can afford to become complacent. And on the other hand, just because the numbers are spiking, doesn’t mean we should give up in despair. Let’s keep working together, and let’s remember that together we will get through this. As we prepare for the arrival of safe and effective vaccines, it is important to keep up with our other efforts. It is clear what needs to be done. Make sure you wear your mask, wash your hands, keep your distance, and download and use the COVID Alert app. Avoid gatherings and don’t put yourself or others at risk. And together, we’ll get through this. This morning, I also want to recognize that 50 years ago today, the Report by the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada was tabled in Parliament. When it was published, this report was a landmark document, helping drive progress on gender equality. Fifty years later, we’ve come a long way. But with this pandemic impacting women disproportionately, we’re reminded that there is still much further to go. One of the most significant recommendations of the Royal Commission was to take action on child care. Today, we are committed to moving forward with a universal child care system. Our government will continue to take the steps needed to build – and rebuild – a fairer, more equal Canada for everyone. Today, I also want to recognize the news that National Chief Perry Bellegarde will not be running for another term. Perry has been a tireless leader and advocate for First Nations, and I know I am joined by people across the country in recognizing and celebrating his years of devoted service to First Nations communities. We lift you up, Perry. We will continue to work with the National Chief to advance the priorities identified by First Nations, including keeping First Nations communities safe from this pandemic. Finally, I would like to conclude by congratulating Michael Sabia on his new role as Deputy Minister of Finance. He has done an outstanding job as President of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, and I know his skills will be invaluable to us as we rebuild a strong and resilient economy. Paul Rochon has served as Deputy Minister of Finance since 2014, and I would also like to thank him for all his years of dedication and exceptional work during this pandemic.   Thank you all."

I’m very pleased to be here this morning along with Minister Anand, Major-General Fortin, Dr.Tam, and Dr.Njoo. Before I get started, I want to address the news we got last night that Master Sailor Duane Earle of the HMCS Winnipeg is believed to have gone overboard in the Pacific. As Minister Sajjan has said, we are dedicating every resource to the search. To Master Sailor Earle’s family and loved ones, we’re keeping you in our thoughts during this incredibly difficult time. And to everyone aboard HMCS Winnipeg, we are standing with you. I know that this has already been a very challenging year for those serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. This morning, I just came from visiting the Ottawa Hospital. I thanked them for their outstanding work, day in and day out, throughout the months of this pandemic, for everything they’re doing to keep us and our loved ones safe. I also spoke to nurses, doctors, and staff about delivering vaccine doses. We are at the beginning of the end with the arrival of vaccine doses, but there is still a lot of work to be done to keep Canadians safe in the coming months and I know that they will be there for us. On Sunday night, the very first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Canada. Less than 24 hours later, vaccinations had already started for the most vulnerable and for frontline workers.  This morning, I have even more good news to share.   I can announce that Canada has secured our second agreement for early doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Canada is now contracted to receive up to 168,000 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine before the end of December, pending Health Canada approval. These doses are part of the guaranteed 40 million doses we have secured from Moderna, and deliveries could begin within 48 hours of regulatory approval. Like the co-founder of Moderna pointed out a few weeks ago, Canada was among the very first to pre-order their vaccine. That, combined with our solid plan for vaccine rollout, is why we have an agreement for early doses. As with the early shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, this moves us even further forward on getting Canadians protected as quickly as possible. The regulatory process for the Moderna vaccine is ongoing, but again, I want to assure Canadians that any vaccine approved in Canada will be both safe and effective. No one, and no community, will be left behind. We have a plan to reach everyone who wants a vaccine, no matter where they live. Of course, shipping in the winter – especially to the far North – isn’t without its challenges. The Moderna vaccine does not need some of the extra special handling requirements of the one from Pfizer, including ultra-cold freezers. And that makes it a better option to ship over long distances to more remote areas. So, doses of this vaccine will be directed to the North, as well as to remote, and Indigenous communities. The territories are scheduled to receive doses of the Moderna vaccine in the coming weeks, pending Health Canada approval. We are working to ensure the logistics planning is ready when vaccines are available, and have already shipped medical-grade freezers to the North.  As soon as we get the green light, we’ll be ready to go. On Pfizer, I also have an update to share. We’ve now confirmed that next week we will receive about 200,000 of our total early order of doses from Pfizer. As well, we will have 70 sites ready to administer these doses, up from 14 sites this week. Canada now has agreements to receive up to 417,000 doses by January 1. I would like to thank Minister Anand for her unbelievable leadership on this issue, but I’d also like to highlight the remarkable work that Major-General Fortin, his team, and all the employees at the Public Health Agency are doing to ensure the rollout of vaccines. This is a pan-Canadian effort. Our government will continue working with the provinces and territories, through the National Operations Centre, to ensure that the doses are distributed to Canadians as quickly as possible. As I announced at the First Ministers’ meeting last week, the federal government will cover 100 per cent of the cost of vaccines and the supplies necessary to administer them. The doses will be free for Canadians. And the provinces and territories will not have to dip into their budgets to pay for them either. In addition to vaccines, we’re also continuing to invest in treatments for COVID-19. Today, I can announce that we are providing up to $6.7 million for the Canadian company Arch Biopartners, to support the development of their leading drug candidate to treat severe COVID-19 cases. This new funding was provided on the advice of Canada’s leading experts in the field who are serving on our COVID-19 Therapeutics Task Force. Progress on made-in-Canada treatments, a second agreement for early delivery of vaccine doses, the most vulnerable already starting to receive these life-saving shots – this is the good news we all needed. This pandemic will end. We will get through this. But for now, we need to be incredibly careful. Keep each other safe. Keep your grandparents safe. Keep our doctors and nurses safe. Do the things you know that are going to help us get through this long winter. Vaccines are coming. Vaccines are already here, but we need to make it through this winter in the best possible situation without seeing more tragedies, without seeing more losses, that means we all have to do our part. It is not a time for holiday gatherings. We have to be very cautious and continue our efforts. Keep your distance. Wear a mask. Use the COVID Alert app. Avoid gatherings. Wash your hands. Continue to do everything that needs to be done to protect one another. 2020 was a long year, but we will be able to celebrate in 2021 when this pandemic will be over. We can see the end is near with the vaccines. But between now and then we must remain cautious. We have to do everything possible to protect our loved ones. Job one for our government is protecting Canadians. That’s why we’ve been working around the clock on procuring everything from PPE to rapid tests to safe, effective vaccines. But let’s remember: this is a global pandemic. To end COVID-19 anywhere, we have to end it everywhere. To quickly get rid of COVID-19, people everywhere must have access to vaccines as soon as possible. Again yesterday, Ministers Gould and Anand announced that Canada was going to invest an additional $485 million in global cooperation to step up access to tools to fight COVID-19. This investment will provide treatment and vaccines, as well as health care resources to developing countries.   In addition, to continue protecting the health of the most vulnerable, Minister Gould announced that Canada will also be providing funding to help various nutrition and food security programs. The fight against COVID-19 is a joint effort. We must work together to defeat this virus and build a stronger, healthier future for everyone. Finally, I want to end this morning by recognizing that today marks the 5th anniversary of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report. The Residential School system was one of the darkest chapters in our history, and has left a tragic legacy that continues to this day. To the survivors, family members, and all those who shared their truth – your courage and strength are remarkable. I also want to recognize the leadership of Senator Murray Sinclair, who is retiring from the Senate in January. His work as the chief commissioner changed Canada for the better. Senator Sinclair – like so many others who were part of the Commission – showed us the path forward. And it’s up to us to walk the path of reconciliation. Together with survivors and communities, we have made important progress on the Commission’s Calls to Action. Eighty per cent of the calls that are the sole or shared responsibility of the federal government are now completed or well underway. In the last few weeks alone, we invested half a billion dollars to support Indigenous communities in exercising their jurisdiction over child and family services. We introduced legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our government will continue to work in partnership on everything from closing gaps in infrastructure to ending inequalities in the criminal justice system. We have moved forward, but we’re not done yet. The national tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls must finally end. Over the last five years, we have worked with partners and communities to put a stop to violence against Indigenous women, girls, LGBTQ and two-spirit people. Today, Minister Bennet highlighted the investments that will help us to continue moving forward, namely the establishment of new shelters and a global violence prevention strategy. Our government will continue to be a partner in the efforts made to reach reconciliation and build a better future for all. Thank you everyone."
"24","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2021/01/05/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-covid-19-situation-vaccines-and","Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on the COVID-19 situation, vaccines, and travel restrictions",2021-01-05,"Hello everyone. Happy New Year. As we begin this new year, I know a lot of people are wondering what to expect in 2021. Although the pandemic is far from over, I want to start today by telling you that we have reasons to be optimistic.  Two safe and effective vaccines have been approved in Canada and we have started receiving doses of those vaccines over the past few weeks. Our government already delivered nearly half a million doses to the provinces and territories. And those efforts are continuing. We’re on track to have well over a million vaccine doses from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of January. And by September, we’ll have enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian who wants a shot. The vaccines will allow us to protect people and save lives. That’s why it’s essential that the provinces and territories conduct their immunization campaigns as quickly as possible. The federal government is covering the cost of the vaccines and the supplies needed to administer them. And we are coordinating the logistics of deploying vaccines all across the country through the National Operations Centre, which is supported by the Canadian Armed Forces. This pandemic will end. We will get through this. Better days are on the horizon, but to get there, we need to keep holding on. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: now is not the time to vacation abroad. We must stay the course. Let me also be very clear about the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. This program was created to give people sick leave if they needed it and otherwise wouldn’t have one from their employer. It exists, for example, for the grocery store employee who needs to isolate because he’s been in contact with a colleague who has tested positive, or if he himself has symptoms. The employee therefore does not have to choose between losing his income and isolating to protect others. The goal has never been to send a cheque to those who decide to go on a trip, against public health advice. My message to those who have gone south is clear. You will not be entitled to this benefit. It’s not there to pay for someone’s post-vacation quarantine. To those who were angry after reading the news this weekend, I share your indignation. We are correcting the situation quickly. I know you have made a lot of sacrifices over the past few months and the bottom line is that anyone who travelled for non-essential reasons will not be able to access the sickness benefit. We’ll have more details soon. We have been telling Canadians since March to avoid all non-essential travel. We will continue hammering this message on all platforms. And there is a mandatory quarantine for anyone returning to the county, no exceptions, with very severe legal consequences if it is not respected. Canada has long had some of the strongest travel measures in the world. Since March, these rules have helped save lives. It’s important, to protect our loved ones and health care workers, and to ensure that our hospitals are not overwhelmed. As new strains of COVID-19 emerge, as cases skyrocket in countless countries, this is the time to double down on keeping you and your family safe.   Starting Thursday, to be eligible to return to Canada, travellers must have a negative COVID-19 test before boarding their flight. This is in addition to the long-standing mandatory two-week quarantine once people arrive. Officials are reviewing travellers’ isolation plans. And if the plan is not up to par, the travellers will have to quarantine in a federal facility. Earlier today, I also spoke with President Ramaphosa of South Africa, including about our work together on fighting COVID-19 and the global response to this pandemic. Canada and South Africa have long worked as partners to keep our citizens safe, and build a healthier, brighter future for everyone. As we face this pandemic, we will continue to stand together. This includes on fighting the virus and on ensuring that no one gets left behind as we rebuild. On public health in particular, Canada is taking the steps needed to protect Canadians and stop the spread of COVID-19. We’ve put in place additional screening and enhanced measures to respond to new challenges wherever they occur around the world. We’ve been very clear. No one should be vacationing abroad right now. But if you still decide to travel at your own risk, you will need to show a negative COVID-19 test before you return, and you must self-isolate for two weeks when you get back. You need to take this seriously. Not following the rules could mean real consequences, including fines and prison time. So many people gave up so much more than just a vacation over the holidays. There’s a reason so many Canadians made those tough but responsible decisions. There’s a reason so many Canadians did their part. It was for the people around them.   For the senior that is better protected. For the frontline worker who is safer on the job. For the small business owner who could look with more confidence to reopening. We can’t let the sacrifices we’ve made over the holidays—and over the last 10 months—go to waste. This afternoon, I’ll be speaking with local business owners in B.C. and P.E.I. who are working hard to keep employees on the payroll. Later, I’ll also have a chance to drop in on a virtual classroom with students in Edmonton. As a former teacher, these classroom meetings are among my favourites. Our kids are doing an incredible job of not just adapting, but also looking out for each other. So to all the kids doing virtual school this year, and with a lot of you starting up this week—you’re doing great. Keep it up. And remember, even as you’re trying to figure out how to get virtual school going, this is tough for your parents, too. So maybe give them an extra hug at the end of the day, and you know maybe for once do the dishes without being prompted or asked to it. We’re all in this together and the more we can help each other out, the better we’re going to make it through this. Right across the country, people of every age are doing their part. Now is not the time to give up.   With rising cases, many provinces that have already made tough decisions will have to continue doing so, whether with local restrictions or province-wide shutdowns. It’s not easy, but it is necessary. Our government will be there as a partner for all orders of government, as they make the right choices to keep people safe. Working together is what will get us through this crisis. Because we’re not out of the woods yet. On New Year’s Eve, there were over 8,400 new COVID-19 cases reported in Canada. The day before, there had been almost 7,500 cases. These aren’t just numbers. Hundreds of families are grieving someone they lost over the holidays. Thousands more are worried about a loved one in hospital. Countless paramedics, nurses, and doctors are struggling to keep up with new patient after new patient. That’s what’s at stake here. That’s why your choices matter. By wearing a mask, by keeping your distance, and by avoiding gatherings, you are keeping yourself and others safe. And by using the COVID Alert app, you are helping to stop the virus from spreading. Take, for example, last Thursday, when hundreds of people entered their unique code in the application after receiving a positive test result. That simple act will prevent hundreds of other people from contracting the virus. Fighting COVID-19 is a team effort and, together, we will succeed in curbing this pandemic. Over the past few weeks alone, our government has provided additional support to communities that needed it. I am referring to the presence of the Red Cross in long-term care facilities in Quebec and the Canadian Rangers in the First Nations community of Ekuanitshit.  And we are ready to do more if needed. Across the country, and especially in Ontario, long-term care homes are facing extremely concerning outbreaks of COVID-19. This is unacceptable. Our elders, our parents and grandparents, built this country. They raised us. And they deserve the very best possible care. We’ve already lost too many elders in long-term care. The tragedies of the spring must not be repeated. As we have been since March, our government is here to support provinces in getting the situation under control in their jurisdictions. Already, we have been in touch with the Government of Ontario, and stand ready to provide additional, targeted help. Today, just like when we first deployed the Armed Forces and the Red Cross during the first wave, our top priority is keeping people safe.    I’ll be bringing up long-term care homes with all premiers on Thursday at our First Ministers’ Meeting, as well as shared work on vaccine distribution and measures on borders and travel. We’re all in this fight together. And our government will always be here to do our part. An Armed Forces deployment, boosted testing, isolation measures—this can be the difference between local outbreaks becoming a crisis or becoming under control. I think of when the Shamattawa First Nation in Manitoba requested emergency support to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak in their community over the past weeks. The federal government deployed the Canadian Armed Forces, who worked side by side with the community on testing, contact tracing, and isolation capacity. And today, cases are a fraction of where they were, and the community continues to work hard to stop the spread of the virus. To all those working on the ground, whether with the Canadian Armed Forces or the Red Cross, in a hospital or with a community organization: thank you. You are doing an incredible job. We will continue to be here for you. In the weeks and months to come, our government will continue to provide assistance to those who need it. I promise that 2021 will be better than 2020, but it will still not be easy. But together, we will get through this. Happy New Year, everyone. To all of us."

From coast to coast to coast, vaccination is underway. As of last week, we had delivered close to a million doses total to the provinces and territories. There’s still a lot of work to do, but these shipments are already bringing relief – and hope – to communities across the country. Every day, more vulnerable people in long-term care homes and more health care workers are getting vaccinated. And in Indigenous and northern communities, too, the immunization campaign is ongoing. Last week, on Vancouver Island, 600 doses arrived for the Cowichan Tribes. Within just two days, every single one had been administered. Over the weekend, nine Cree communities in northern Quebec received boxes of doses. And in the coastal Inuit community of Nain, Nunatsiavut, Canadian Rangers were deployed and did great work to support the vaccination efforts.   This is what teamwork looks like. To everyone who’s part of this effort: thank you. When we work towards a common goal, we get results for all Canadians. Now, even with this good news, the situation is still critical. Our fight is not over. That’s why we have the plan Canada needs to get you and your family vaccinated as soon as possible, and to deal with any roadblocks that come up in our way. For example, Pfizer’s global supply issues are not ideal, but that’s why we were so ambitious in the large numbers of contracts we signed and doses we secured. I can tell you that Minister Anand is in contact with the company every day. Remember: This situation with the Pfizer delay is temporary. Our vaccination objectives for the first quarter of the year – January to March – are not changing. The total number of doses committed to us is still the same, with every Canadian who wants to get vaccinated able to get vaccinated by September. When I say that everyone has to do their part, I am also speaking to travellers. Now is not the time to travel abroad. If you have plans to leave the country, please, on behalf of all Canadians, cancel them. A trip south or elsewhere is not worth catching COVID-19 and bringing it back to Canada. As you know, travellers must quarantine when they return to the country and the consequences are very severe for those who do not do it. As for the new variants of the virus – in England, Brazil, and South Africa – we are monitoring the situation very closely. But one thing is certain: with these new mutations, circumstances could change very quickly. So, again, we are asking all Canadians to stay here, in the country. Especially since ministers are continuing to assess various issues day-to-day, and new measures could be imposed without notice, depending on the situation. More than ever before during this pandemic, our personal choices affect the safety and health of others. Let us continue to be vigilant. We must continue to help one another. When we do not follow guidelines, it is our health care workers and our most vulnerable that we put at risk. But remember, this situation is temporary. Vaccines are coming. We need to hang on for the next few months. Like you, I can't wait for spring to arrive. It’s absolutely critical that everyone keeps doing their part to slow the spread of COVID-19. We owe it to ourselves, to our families, and to everyone around us.   In a few months, spring will be here. So now is not the time to abandon our efforts. I think of the tragic and unacceptable situation in long-term care facilities in Ontario and across the country. Our parents and grandparents deserve better. Our nurses deserve better. So to the residents: We’re doing everything we can to get you your vaccine as quickly as possible. And to the workers: I know your families are worried, as you are worried about them. I know that your kids are afraid to lose you every time you go to work, and you’re afraid of bringing home the virus. So if you haven’t already received it, we’re getting you your vaccine as soon as possible. So thank you for everything that you do. Your dedication, your commitment to Canadians impress us all. There’s a lot more work to be done, but we’re making important progress. Last Friday, Mayor Watson here in Ottawa said that all long-term care homes in the city have finished their first round of vaccination. In Quebec, three quarters of long-term care home residents have had their first shot. More doses are coming and we won’t stop until everyone is safe.     As many provinces announced stricter measures to stop the spread of the virus in recent weeks, many people are still worried about their jobs and about the future. Our government has created programs to help you, and we will be there for you for as long as it takes. During the Cabinet retreat, the team considered our strategy to continue supporting families, workers, and businesses. To get a picture of the national and global economies, we received presentations from two experts – Kevin Milligan from the University of British Columbia and Frances Donald from Manulife – and we talked about the recovery.         As Canada recovers from this global crisis, we want to make sure that everyone – every worker, parent, and young person – lands back on their feet. To help do that, part of our strategy is ensuring that Canada becomes the global clean tech leader, and that Canadian workers be at the forefront of that vision. On that note, it’s great to see that Unifor members ratified their agreement with General Motors Canada to build battery-electric commercial vans here in Canada.  Including this agreement, deals that have been announced over the past few months have secured nearly $6 billion of investments in the Canadian automotive sector. These deals are protecting and creating good, middle-class jobs. And they’re creating new opportunities right across the country. With these investments, Canadian automotive workers and businesses will continue to lead in growing markets for efficient, electrified, and smart vehicles. Like we said when we presented our climate plan – A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy – clean technology presents enormous opportunities for economic growth and jobs. When a project is good for workers, for growing the middle class and for protecting the environment, everybody wins. There’s still a lot of work to be done to rebuild a stronger, cleaner, and more inclusive economy. And announcements like these are exactly what we need to get there. Before we end today, I’d like to say a few words about this week’s inauguration in the United States. Tomorrow, Canadians and people around the world will be watching the swearing-in of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris. This moment will mark a new chapter in the incredible relationship between our two countries. I also want to address reports surrounding the Keystone XL project. Yesterday, I spoke with our Ambassador Kirsten Hillman. We’ve had a clear and consistent position supporting this project for years. Our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered by the incoming administration at the highest levels. And of course, I’m really looking forward to working closely with the new president and his team to create jobs and build back better for us all. Thank you, everyone."

I want to begin today with a few words about travel and travellers. We’ve closed the borders since March to everyone for whom Canada is not home. Our border measures are strong, they’re tailored to the evolving situation, and they’re working. We know that, currently, there is only a small percentage of cases coming from Canadians returning to the country. Canada has some of the strictest travel and border measures in the world. We have a two-week quarantine for everyone returning to the country.    And we now have a mandatory negative test before flying home. These measures work. They’re saving lives. And that’s why our friends and allies are following suit. Just take the United States, where they’ve recently adopted the same requirement for a negative test before flying back into the country. That being said, I want to be very clear: each case is one case too many. We’re doing whatever it takes to keep Canadians safe. As I’ve said, it’s not the time to travel, especially not during the upcoming spring break. We will not hesitate to take even tougher measures if and when they’re needed and we’ll be making an announcement in the coming days. When it comes to protecting you and your family – nothing is off the table. The bad choices of a few will never be allowed to put everyone else in danger. So: Avoid all non-essential travel, whether it’s abroad or to another province. Cancel your vacation plans down south. There will be other opportunities to travel – at a more appropriate time that’s even more enjoyable for you – once the pandemic is under control. I know that the winter is long and the time goes slowly, but we must continue our efforts. Of course, travel is only one part of the equation when it comes to beating COVID-19. Fighting this pandemic also means we need the tools to test and trace the spread of the virus right here at home.  In the last week alone, we’ve delivered over a million rapid tests to the provinces and territories.  That brings us to 15.4 million rapid tests that we’ve sent out to the frontlines. And even more are on the way. Testing is key to be able to fight COVID-19 and be in the best possible position when mass vaccinations begin in the spring. We’re doing everything we can to help you and your family get through this crisis. But we can’t do it on our own. We also need you. I talked about travellers earlier and strict border measures, but we also can’t forget that it’s through community transmission in particular that the virus is continuing to spread. There are still people who think they’re exceptions to the rules, and unfortunately, that leads to increasing cases. Hospitals are on the verge of being overwhelmed. Surgeries are being postponed. We must do what we can, what’s needed, to follow public health guidelines. Stay home. Avoid gatherings. Wear your masks.  And download and use the COVID Alert app. I think about all of the people who’ve been on the frontlines of this fight against COVID-19 for almost a year now. They know how far we’ve come. And they know that we need to keep going, just a little longer. To our doctors, nurses, and long-term care workers: Thank you. From Victoria to Iqaluit to St. John’s, you’re taking care of our parents, grandparents, and friends. Right now, you’re working longer hours than ever. You are our heroes.  Your service and dedication every day is remarkable. New challenges will arise during this uncertain time, but I know that, together, we’re prepared to face them. I had a call this morning with the CEO of Moderna, who confirmed to me again that the contracts we signed very early on with them will be fulfilled. In addition, as planned, before the end of March, we will also receive our 4 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. By September, all Canadians who want a vaccine will be able to get one. The vaccines are safe and effective, and we are working tirelessly to be able to deploy them as quickly as possible. Now it may only be January, but this winter is already turning out to be a long one. And for many business owners who are worried about how to get through to better days, I know that spring and summer seem a long way off. When this pandemic started, we made a promise that we’d be there for Canadians. And every day since, we’ve done exactly that.  Our government has rolled out the largest economic measures in Canada’s history to support small businesses across the country, from the Canada Emergency Business Account to the wage subsidy.   But even with this help, during a second wave, things are tough. For many businesses and their employees, it’s hard to get back on their feet. That’s why we’re now partnering with Canada’s largest financial institutions to introduce the new Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program, or HASCAP. Through HASCAP, Canadian-based businesses that have been hardest hit by the pandemic will be able to receive low-interest loans of up to $1 million. These are 100 per cent Government of Canada-backed loans, and can be used for rent, utilities, and help with payroll.  Later today, Minister Ng will have more details to share about the loans, including how to access this support once applications open on February 1. While we are helping those who have been hardest hit get through this crisis, we also have to think about after the pandemic. As vaccines continue to arrive, there is hope on the horizon. Together, we will be able to rebuild a stronger, more resilient economy where everyone has a chance to succeed. An economy with good jobs so that workers can support their families, in a cleaner and healthier environment. We have work to do, but I know that we can do it, together. Thank you."

Before starting today, I’d like to say a few words about the arrest of Mr. Camara in Parc-Extension, in my riding of Papineau. This is a troubling case. There are a number of questions that need to be addressed, including by the various authorities involved in this case. We need to get to the bottom of what happened. My thoughts are with Mr. Camara and with the injured officer. Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen the rate of new cases continue to go down just about everywhere in the country. This is good news. But we can’t let our guard down. There are new variants around the world that are beginning to show up in Canada. We need to continue to do everything we can to protect ourselves and to protect our friends and neighbours. We still have work to do. While several provinces are preparing to relax some of their health measures, I want to provide an update today on the various fronts of our battle against COVID‑19. Let’s start with vaccines. We all want to be done with this pandemic as soon as possible. And that’s exactly why we’re focused on vaccines. The temporary shipment delays that many countries are facing right now are a hurdle, but they’re one that we were ready for. We knew that short-term delays would be a possibility, so we planned accordingly.   But I hear it from all Canadians right now, people are worried. People are tired of this pandemic. They want to know when this winter is going to be over. They want to know when they can go back to everything they’ve done before. They want to know mostly when their grandparents are going to be safe. When the vaccines are going to come. That’s why there’s a lot of anxiety and there’s a lot of noise going on right now. That’s why I want to reassure Canadians that we’re on track. In late November, we stood before Canadians and we said that we were confident that we were going to get 6 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by Q1 of 2021. That’s the first three months of 2021: January, February, and March. We’re very much on track to getting those 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna by the end of March as we predicted in November. I speak almost every week with the CEOs of these vaccine companies and they have assured me that they will meet their obligations – their contractual obligations – to deliver 6 million doses to Canadians by the end of March. Which means we are still very much on track for 20 million doses in the spring from Pfizer and Moderna, with more vaccine companies in the process of approval right now. And we will get everyone vaccinated by September. Now a friend of mine actually shared with me the story of how they felt a few days ago when their elderly parents in a long-term care home here in Ottawa got their second dose of the vaccine. He said it was a surprise just how much of a relief it was to suddenly not be afraid for your loved ones. That’s a feeling that thousands upon thousands of Canadians are getting right across the country, but we need to get to millions. I know how tired we all are. I know how anxious we are to see our loved ones safe. To see life returning to normal. We feel it too. That’s why we are working every single day to make sure that as many vaccines as possible come into Canada as quickly as possible. And yes the turbulence week over week that we’re seeing is of concern and we’re watching it closely, and we’re staying on it. But let me reassure people we’re still very much on track, as promised, to get those 6 million doses by the end of March. Because that’s what the vaccine company CEOs keep telling me and I’m happy to reassure Canadians on that. We are focused on keeping you and your family safe every step of the way. Our team is in constant contact with the top people involved, as well as with our counterparts in Europe. Over the past weeks I have personally spoken with the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna, and this week, I was on the phone with Pascal Soriot from AstraZeneca. They assured me that they will fulfil all their commitments to Canada. We’ve worked around the clock to negotiate one of the world’s most diverse vaccine portfolios. That's how we have assured more potential doses per person than any other country. In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, three other companies have submitted their vaccines for review by Health Canada: AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax. This review process is independent and has the very highest standards to make sure that every vaccine approved in Canada is both safe and effective. On vaccines, I also want to say a few words about COVAX, which is another important part of our overall plan. When wealthier countries invest in COVAX, half of that funding is for doses at home, and the other half is to buy doses for low- and middle-income countries. In other words, our contribution was always intended to access vaccine doses for Canadians as well as to support lower-income countries. Through COVAX, pending Health Canada approval, we will receive at least 1.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine before the end of June. That’s in addition to the 20 million doses we’ve already secured from AstraZeneca. Canada is committed to making sure that the rest of the world doesn’t get left behind when it comes to vaccination. That’s why we are one of the world’s top donors to COVAX. To beat this virus anywhere, we have to beat it everywhere. In addition to COVAX, we’ve also contributed to other programs specifically designed to help lower-income countries get access to vaccines. Yesterday, we had our 26th meeting with the premiers of the provinces and territories. Of course, we talked about vaccines. For the Pfizer vaccine, the number of doses delivered each week will increase in mid‑February. With Pfizer and Moderna combined, we will receive the 6 million doses by the end of March, just as we’ve been telling Canadians since the end of November. We’re also preparing for the “ramp up” phase that will be starting in April, as planned. In the spring, we expect to receive 20 million doses of the two approved vaccines. This number will be adjusted up as we add other vaccine candidates that are currently being reviewed by Health Canada. Despite the temporary, short-term issues that are affecting many other countries as well, our plan remains strong and we remain committed to our objectives. All Canadians who want a vaccine will be able to get one by September. Last week, we also announced new measures for international travel. All international flights are now limited to four major airports: Montréal, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver. With the support of our airline industry, all flights to and from Mexico and the Caribbean have also been suspended until April 30. As I told the Premiers during our 26th meeting yesterday, our government’s priority has always been to protect Canadians. That’s exactly what we’re continuing to do. The mandatory PCR testing at the airport and the new three-day quarantine measures will be in place as soon as possible.  In addition to these new rules for flying, we are also looking at ways to further strengthen our land border measures. We’ll have more to announce on this soon. As vaccines continue to arrive, we must absolutely use the other tools at our disposal to contain the virus. Testing has to be a key part of our strategy, particularly because cases are going down and the provinces are starting to look at reopening. Whether it’s at schools, long-term care facilities, or workplaces, rapid testing is an effective way to prevent outbreaks. And so I continue to strongly encourage the provinces and territories to use these tests. When it comes to people’s safety, and to the economy as well, we all have to work together to make sure that trends in new cases continue downward. This morning, we learned that the Canadian economy lost 213,000 jobs in January, most of them part‑time jobs in the retail sector. Since the start of the pandemic, our government has acted quickly to provide direct support to Canadians, workers, and small businesses. Whether it’s through programs like the wage subsidy and commercial rent assistance or the changes we made to Employment Insurance, we will not abandon you.  For those who need assistance, you can go to the website Canada.ca/coronavirus to get more information about our different supports.  We’ll continue to be here for you. If you’ve lost your job, we’re thinking of you and we have ways to support you. We’re working tirelessly to provide vaccines as quickly as possible. We know that spring is coming and things will improve, and until then, we’ll be here for each other. No matter where you live, our focus is on keeping you and your community safe. On that note, today, I can announce that we have approved a request for federal assistance for Pauingassi First Nation in Northern Manitoba. The Canadian Armed Forces will begin deployment as soon as possible. They’ll be arriving on Saturday at the latest and will be there until February 10th. Once they’re on the ground, members of the Forces will be providing logistical support, transporting goods and medical supplies, and conducting wellness checks. Just as they have since the start of this crisis, our women and men in uniform are stepping up to the plate. They’re doing a great job, and making a real, positive difference for the people who need it most. Over the last year, we’ve seen people across the country come together to support each other through this incredibly difficult time. After all, that’s just who we are.   In Canada, we just help each other out. We learn from our differences. We celebrate diversity and compassion. These Canadian values are what makes us stronger as a country, and as a democracy. And we will always stand up to protect them. On Wednesday, Minister Blair announced that 13 new groups are now listed as terrorist entities, including ideologically motivated extremist groups like the Proud Boys. These decisions were made after thorough information-gathering by Canada’s security and intelligence officials, often over months and years. To be listed, a group must meet a high legal threshold. The listing can then help stop their dangerous activities, and facilitate criminal investigations and prosecutions. Among other things, this means that under the law, it is now a crime to deal knowingly with the property or finances of these hateful groups. We will continue to do whatever it takes to keep Canadians safe. We will continue to fight hate and violence online. And we will continue to protect our communities and our places of worship. Just last week, I spoke to my friend Rabbi Adam Scheier, whose synagogue in Montréal was recently vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti. He mentioned that enhanced security measures – made possible by our Security Infrastructure Program as well as extremely alert security guards – meant that the alleged perpetrator was caught quickly before he could do more serious damage. Violent extremism has no place in our country. We will always stand up to groups and individuals who use violence to target our fellow Canadians, or to attack our democratic systems. I want to end today by coming back to our COVID‑19 response, specifically vaccines. I know there’s a lot of anxiety and so I’ll repeat: on our end, our plan is in motion. I want to reassure people watching at home: I know you’re waiting for all this to be over as quickly as possible. I know you’re anxiously waiting for your vaccine. I know you’re mostly very anxious for your grandparents to receive their vaccine. We’re working tirelessly, every day, to get through this pandemic together. Since the beginning, we’ve been here for people, with assistance for workers, families, and businesses. With border measures. We’ve been here to support the provinces, including with the Armed Forces in long-term care facilities. And we’re here for people when it comes to vaccines. We negotiated more contracts, more doses than virtually any other country. And we are in the process of delivering on this. As I said in November, we announced that in the first quarter of 2021 we would receive 6 million of the Pfizer and Moderna doses. And I’m speaking on a regular basis with both of these companies, who assure us, promise us, that they will deliver these 6 million doses by the end of next month. We’re headed in the right direction, on course to end this pandemic. I know that the turbulence we’re experiencing right now, week over week, may be causing a lot of worry for people. But I want to reassure you: we will be where we need to be, where we promised we would be, by the end of next month. We’ll be there with 20 million doses in the spring, from Pfizer and Moderna. We’ll be there for more doses from other companies as they are approved. And we’ll keep our promise to have a vaccine for everyone in Canada who wants one before the end of September. We’ll get through this. We are continuing to work for you and with you. The summer and the months ahead are going to be better than this winter has been. Thank you, everyone."

I’m happy to be here this morning with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and Minister Champagne. A year ago, there was so much to learn about this new virus and the pandemic was about to be declared. But right from the start, one thing was clear – that Canadians would step up to whatever challenges lay ahead. Well, every day since, we’ve seen that to be true. From the experts running testing centres and doing world-class modelling, to the manufacturers making masks and gloves – Canadian know-how has kept people safe. It has saved lives, and it has helped us chart the path through this crisis.  And that is something worth investing in. When researchers learn more about a virus like COVID-19, develop better cancer treatments, or make our air cleaner, they help save lives. Of course, science also helps us make sure our kids inherit a healthier planet. In other words, research is important. It improves our lives each and every day. And that’s exactly why we must continue to support it. Today, we are taking another historic step forward for Canadian innovation. With $518 million through the Canada Foundation for Innovation, we’re investing in ground‑breaking research. This funding will support over 100 projects – and hundreds of researchers – whether in studying viruses like COVID-19, or developing cancer treatments and fighting climate change. Just take the research into digital healthcare that’ll be possible because of today’s investment. With this funding, doctors at Women’s College Hospital in Toronto will be able to develop a cutting‑edge virtual care lab. This will move us forward on getting everyone the healthcare they need, even if they can’t leave their home. After the year we’ve had, I think it’s clear why that matters. Of course, when it comes to innovation what we’re all thinking about right now is vaccines. With our historic investment of $518 million in Canadian research through the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, we’re supporting efforts to manufacture vaccines in Canada. Through the Innovation Fund, a team of researchers from the CHU de Québec-Université Laval is working on ways to continue ramping up vaccine development and testing right here in Canada. This funding will support that work and work being done right across the country. Canadian innovation is one of our best tools to beat this pandemic. That’s why we’ve made historic investments in science and research to fight COVID-19. And that’s why – since 2015 – we’ve funded domestic vaccine research, development, and manufacturing. In the last five years, we’ve made historic investments in science and research. This pandemic has reminded us why that matters so much. And the pandemic has reminded us that there’s work still to do. An investment in innovation is an investment in you and your family. It’s an investment for today, tomorrow, and years to come. Canadians have the know-how and the creativity to meet any challenge, and we will always be there to support that. Whether it’s vaccines or virtual care, your health is our top priority. And with that, I’d like to update you on vaccine deliveries. This week, Canada hit a big milestone – 2 million vaccines administered across the country. This is a true Team Canada effort. We’ve been working every single day to reach our targets, and everyone who wants to, will be vaccinated by the end of September.   Maybe your grandparent, your parent, your family member, or friend has already gotten their shot, or has an appointment to do it soon. We all want that feeling of relief. To everyone – know that your vaccine is on the way. Very early this morning, our first half a million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, from the Serum Institute, arrived in Canada. Already, the National Operations Centre has worked with provinces and territories to coordinate shipments of these vaccines across the country. Our priority is getting doses into arms as quickly as possible. Because we’ve got a lot more vaccines on the way. With Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, we will receive a total of more than 1.8 million doses this week and next week. What these numbers mean is that someone you know may get vaccinated soon – parents, grandparents, and front line workers. It’s the light at the end of the tunnel you’ve been waiting for. Thank you to everyone waiting patiently for their parents and grandparents to get their shot first. If you’ve already made an appointment to get a shot, I know you will continue to be careful and protect yourself and others. Just last June, I met Luc. He’s the owner of Régimbal Awards and Promotions, a family business here in Ottawa. The first wave of the pandemic hit their business hard, but with the wage subsidy and rent support, they were able to rehire staff and keep their doors open. Well, eight months later and Luc’s store is still going strong. In fact, they’re even continuing to give back to the local fight against COVID-19 with their #StrongerTogether campaign. Through this great initiative, they’re donating proceeds from their fabric face masks, tees, and hoodies to the Ottawa Community Foundation for the most vulnerable in the city. Across the country, there are so many stories like Luc’s. To date, the wage subsidy has supported more than 5 million people. And the rent subsidy has been there for over 129,000 businesses and organizations. We’ve come a long way in the fight against this pandemic. But we’re not out of the woods yet. So for Luc, and for people across the country, I have some important news to share. We are extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy and Lockdown Support at their current levels until June. In other words, we’re making sure that the wage and rent subsidies continue through the spring and that the amount of support remains consistent. This isn’t the time to pull back on support for workers or business owners. It’s the time to see people through what is hopefully the final stretch of this crisis. And it’s the time to get the whole economy ready to come roaring back. So that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Whether you’re an employee or a business owner, you’ll have the certainty and the support you need to get through the spring and get back on track. Times are tough, but we’ll be here with the support you need to get through this crisis, for as long as it lasts. Spring is coming. Vaccines are on their way. Better days are ahead. Thank you."

In February last year, the coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 gave us a new word – COVID-19. But even as COVID-19 took hold of our planet, even as this new word took over our lives, we found ourselves talking about other words, too. About words that weren’t new at all – sacrifice and solidarity, compassion and community.  When the pandemic hit last year, these words – words that have defined Canadians for generations – were suddenly given new meaning.     It has been a tough year, a heartbreaking year, but it has been a year that we have faced together. And that is something we must never forget. Mr. Speaker, on this National Day of Observance for COVID-19, we remember the people we’ve lost.   Grandparents and parents. Brothers and sisters. Friends and colleagues. Each one was loved. Each one was special. Mr. Speaker, it is officially one year since the pandemic began. March 11, 2020, will always be a date that divides time into “before” and “after.” For families and for loved ones, each death also has a “before” and “after”. Today, we remember those who lost their lives to COVID‑19. They are no longer with us, but they live on in our memories. Since the major wars of the 20th century, there is a phrase that is used again and again. It’s a phrase that comes to mind for those lost this year during the pandemic. We will remember them. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Canadians were asked to stay home and stay safe. And yet even apart, or perhaps because we were apart, our communities became stronger and stronger. Businesses stepped up to produce PPE when we needed it most. Some went from making hockey masks to face shields – it doesn’t get more Canadian than that. Students and teachers learned how to do school online, and kids did the dishes while they were doing their homework. Young people across the country stepped up to help their neighbours, to serve their communities. Essential workers made sure the shelves were still stocked with food. People cheered from balconies in solidarity with healthcare workers, the heroes of this pandemic. Brave women and men in the Armed Forces answered the call of duty for Indigenous communities and for the Greatest Generation now in long-term care homes. They were there for our parents and grandparents. And through that service, we saw clearly that for every senior in Canada, we must do better. And I know that we will. In spite of everything, there is hope on the horizon. Vaccinations are ramping up. Millions of doses are on their way. Now is certainly not the time to give up. Mr. Speaker, while Canadians continue their efforts, I know that they are reassured when they see all their leaders working together. Across party lines. Across levels of government.   We are living through an unprecedented crisis. It will take the talent, expertise, and ideas of all Canadians to write the sequel together. We cannot rebuild a fair economy for everyone if we are divided. We cannot develop major social projects if we refuse to listen to one another. For the last year we have worked together to make it through, and this year we will continue to work together to rebuild. Compassion and community. Sacrifice and solidarity. This is where we find meaning in the depths of grief. This is our light through a dark time. Every Canadian we lost to this virus will be remembered. Every shift done by a front line nurse, every mask made by a Canadian worker, will not be forgotten. We are stronger together. Today, tomorrow, and always.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

As Secretary-General Guterres and Prime Minister Holness have said, today we are hosting another joint meeting on financing for development.  I want to thank the Secretary-General for the support he has offered for these meetings, and the Prime Minister for his partnership on this initiative since last May.  In the last year, our world has faced a pandemic, a global economic crisis, and the continued crisis of climate change.  It goes without saying that these are very serious challenges on a very significant scale.  Take the global economic front alone:   Several countries have already defaulted, a significant number of emerging economies face serious fiscal challenges, and many developing countries are in debt distress. This comes on top of the economic effects of ongoing emergencies like climate change, which have only been made worse by the pandemic.  As a world, we cannot afford to turn away. Instead, we must learn from this crisis and together, set ourselves on a better path.  Last year Canada convened high-level meetings with Prime Minister Holness and Secretary-General Guterres to begin to shape our global response.  Today, we are continuing that work.  Our meeting is focused on 4 main areas – enhancing global liquidity, extending and expanding debt relief, larger reforms on debt relief, and eligibility for international assistance. It will also help inform important upcoming discussions at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, as well as in the G20 and G7. Truly “building back better” from this pandemic means creating good jobs and growing clean, resilient economies.  It means ensuring that the legacy of this crisis isn’t one of rolling back progress for anyone. In fact, on that front, earlier this month, Canada launched a new Task Force on Women in the Economy to ensure that no one gets left behind. Because a better future is one where everyone has the chance to succeed.  Canada is focused on real solutions that will help everyone – including the world’s most vulnerable – recover from this crisis.  Together, through meetings like this, we can continue to build a brighter, more prosperous shared future.  We’re now happy to take your questions. "

Before I get started, I want to take a moment to recognize that this will be an incredibly difficult weekend for many people across Nova Scotia. To everyone who lost someone, and to the entire community, know that Canadians are holding you in our hearts. Today, I’m going to talk about public health measures, vaccines, and support for Canadians. Let’s start with public health. Canada continues to face an incredibly serious situation with this third wave. Cases are rising rapidly. In many places, numbers are higher than they’ve ever been before, and far too many hospitals are stretched way too thin. In Toronto in particular, numbers are breaking record after record, and ICU hospital beds are filling up. There’s no doubt that Canada’s largest city is struggling under the weight of this third wave, so we’re going to do whatever it takes to help. On vaccination in particular, Ontario has reached out for more support. I can tell you today that we are standing by to deploy the Canadian Red Cross to help with their mobile vaccination teams. This is about getting doses to people where the situation is most serious. And we’ll also continue to help on a whole range of other fronts, too. Discussions are ongoing about extra health care providers and we are ready to step up. We’ve also already deployed Mobile Health Units that set up more hospital beds in Toronto and Hamilton. For Ontario, we’ve shipped out more health care equipment like oxygen units and drugs to treat COVID-19. We have approved a request to have the Canadian Red Cross deployed in up to 27 long-term care homes as needed. We’re supporting safe isolation sites everywhere from Toronto, to Peel, to Thunder Bay. And we have deployed 300 contact tracers doing thousands of calls a day for Ontario, and lab support which has already processed over 15,000 samples so far. Yesterday, I spoke with Mayor Crombie of Mississauga, Mayor Tory of Toronto, and Mayor Brown of Brampton. We talked about what’s going on in the GTA, and what that means for hospitals, schools, and small businesses. We also talked about the fact that this is a moment when we all have to work together to flatten the curve while getting vaccines into arms as quickly as possible. Earlier this morning, I also spoke with Mayor Scarpitti of Markham. I told him what I told the other Mayors last night – that our government is here to help. And that’s true for every community in Canada. No matter where you live, know that we have your back. We’re supporting COVID-19 testing for people in B.C., Alberta, and Manitoba through mobile labs that can reach more patients. We’re providing help on isolation sites in places like Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, to stop cases spreading. And across the country, we’ve stepped up with money for school safety, shipped out PPE, and of course, delivered vaccines. To front-line workers, people working in hospitals, those they’re caring for, and their families, know that we have your backs even as you have ours. You’ve been heroes throughout this pandemic, stepping forward to help all Canadians. We recognize that. We continue to be there for you. You don’t have to face this alone. We will support you and your families as you keep us all safe. Thank you for what you’re doing. And to all Canadians: I know you’re exhausted. I know you’re all sick and tired of COVID-19. I know nobody wants to be in this third wave, nobody wants to be facing further restrictions. We just want to be done with this. But we know how to do what we need to do. We need to follow the public health rules. We need to hang in there and hunker down for a number of more weeks. Nobody wants to do this. I got into an argument with my 13-year-old this morning who doesn’t want to do this. But we know that if we hang in there, hunker down, and follow the rules for the coming weeks – as much as we’re tired of them, as much as we’re frustrated – we have a chance of getting to the summer in much better shape. This is a moment for us to dig deep, at what is hopefully the very late stages of this pandemic for us all, and make it through. It’s time to show our neighbours and our loved ones what we’re all made of as we keep people safe. Last week, I reminded premiers that we are ready to offer any support they need. We are in a very serious moment of this crisis. It’s important that we continue to work as a team, because together, we will get through this. On vaccines, while we – like many other countries – have been impacted by manufacturing challenges at Moderna’s European facility, this morning I have some very good news to share about Pfizer. Canada has now signed an agreement with Pfizer for eight million more doses of the vaccine. This is on top of what we have already purchased. I want to thank everyone at Pfizer for their cooperation and hard work, not just to keep deliveries on schedule, but to move more doses up and reach new agreements. With the new deal, Canada will receive four million additional Pfizer doses in May, another two million in June, and two million more in July.   For next month alone, this will come out to about double the Pfizer doses we were originally expecting. And millions more in June. All told, we’ll be receiving eight million doses in May and almost 12 million in June from Pfizer alone. Now, that’s a lot of numbers, so here’s the bottom line: More doses arriving sooner means more people getting their vaccines faster. And that means more people who are safer and more families that can breathe a sigh of relief. And we are working around the clock to get every Canadian their vaccine as soon as possible. I know a lot of people – especially young people – are waiting patiently so that their grandparents, parents, and front-line workers can get vaccinated first. Thank you and hang in there. You’ll get your dose soon. We are on track to have everyone who wants to, fully vaccinated by the end of September. I know that this spring has been tough. But the summer and the fall will be better if we hold tight and above all if we follow public health rules. Remember that this won’t last forever. There’s every reason to believe that we’re now in the final – although toughest – stretch of this pandemic. This is not the moment to let up, not even for a second. So no matter where you live, keep your distance, wear a mask, stay home whenever possible, wash your hands, download and use the COVID Alert app, and be sure to follow local public health guidelines. Hang in there a little longer because we’re going to get through this. It’s normal to feel anxious or stressed right now. You are not alone. Your mental health is important and there are people who can help. So if you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out. A year ago, we launched the Wellness Together Canada portal online. The website offers free and confidential mental health and substance use support, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the last year, more than 1.2 million people across the country have used this resource. There’s no shame in needing to speak to someone, or in asking for help. So whether you’re looking for advice, resources, reliable information, or immediate support, you can always visit the Wellness Together Canada website to find help. Whether on vaccines, health care resources, or mental health support, we’re focused on what you and your family need to get through this crisis. On that note, this Monday we will be releasing our 2021 federal budget. In the last few days, I’ve had meetings with all of the party leaders to discuss that budget. As I said to each of them, it’s vital that we work together right now. This is especially true on measures that are about helping you get through this pandemic – whether you’re a parent, a student, a small business owner, or a senior. We’ll have more to say on Monday about our plan to continue keeping Canadians safe, create middle class jobs, and rebuild a clean, resilient economy that works for everyone. But for now, let me just say this: Everything we’re going to lay out in Budget 2021 comes down to having your back through this crisis, and rebuilding a stronger Canada for everyone. Finally, I just spoke with Her Majesty the Queen to extend my deepest condolences – and the condolences of all Canadians – on the passing of His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh. She expressed to me how touched she was by the tributes that have been flowing in from Canada and around the world for Prince Philip. And she highlighted and remembered for me all the fond memories she holds of trips to Canada with him over the past many decades. Prince Philip’s legacy of service will be long remembered here in Canada, especially in his work to empower young people. Thank you."

Happy Friday. Today I want to talk about what we are doing here in Canada in the fight against COVID-19, and about the actions we’re taking internationally as well. Let’s start with the situation here in Canada. In many parts of the country, the number of cases is still increasing rapidly. On Wednesday, I spoke with Premier Kenney and offered whatever help is needed to keep Albertans safe. I also spoke with Mayor Iveson of Edmonton and Mayor Nenshi of Calgary. I let them know that we’re ready to assist in any way possible. In Ontario, the second team of health care workers from Newfoundland and Labrador arrived this week. They’re joining the first team and the Armed Forces members to help in Toronto hospitals. Right across the country, we have to continue doing everything we can to slow the spread of the virus. One of the ways to do that is with screening and testing. So far, we’ve distributed more than 26 million rapid tests to the provinces and territories, and over a million directly to workplaces. Millions more are ready to be deployed. Supporting businesses, organizations, and the public sector in accessing rapid tests is key to identifying and isolating cases, and therefore reducing the risk of further outbreaks. That’s why we’re making it even easier for everyone to access these tests. In Ontario, small and medium-sized businesses and organizations can now get rapid tests at over 40 Shoppers Drug Mart locations. Additional distribution locations and pharmacies will be added soon. Testing works. In April, we invested in the Stay Safe COVID-19 Rapid Screening Program in the Waterloo region, in partnership with the Ontario government, Communitech, and the local chambers of commerce. In just the first two weeks, more than 120,000 free rapid tests have been distributed to over 1,500 businesses. Cases have been found in asymptomatic people who had no idea they were positive, but because of the test result were then able to isolate to prevent transmission. We’re funding similar partnerships right across the country. In Nova Scotia, local public health has been hosting regular rapid screening pop-ups. In Alberta, Suncor is using 300 rapid tests a week for their workers. We need more of these great initiatives because they work. To help, our government will continue to secure tests and get them out to where they’re needed. Rapid tests can be requested directly on a new federal portal, which can be reached through Canada.ca/coronavirus in the “limiting the spread” section.   More screening and testing means safer workplaces and less community transmission, and that will help us reopen our economy faster.     Speaking of the economy, this morning we learned that 207,000 jobs were lost during the month of April, in part because of the various difficult, but necessary, measures taken to combat the third wave. Since the beginning of this crisis, our government has acted to support Canadians. If you’ve lost your job, we won’t let you down. The wage subsidy, more flexible EI, and the Canada Recovery Benefit are there for you. Right now, the best thing we can do for our economy is to end this third wave as quickly as possible. In addition to all of our other efforts to get that done, we are of course continuing to provide vaccines to Canadians. On Wednesday, Health Canada approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for 12 to 15 year olds. Following a rigorous and independent scientific review, the experts concluded that the vaccine is safe and effective for this age group. This is a step forward. It will add one more string to our bow in the fight against COVID-19. To date, more than 18 million doses of vaccine have been shipped to the provinces and territories.  As planned, another 2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine will arrive next week. Yesterday alone, over 350,000 doses were administered across the country. That’s an encouraging number, and here’s another one – 41 per cent of adults in Canada have now received at least a first shot.  I want to thank the provinces and territories for working hard to get Canadians vaccinated as quickly as possible. And to all the health care workers who are part of this effort – thank you. Vaccines are our way out of this crisis. When it’s your turn to get your shot, do your part by making an appointment as soon as you can. If we keep looking out for each other and doing what we know needs to be done, we will get through this. On that note, today, I also want to talk about our efforts to fight COVID-19 around the world. What we’ve seen happening in India is heartbreaking and I know we all want to help. Last week, we announced $10 million in support for the people of India through the Canadian Red Cross. This week, we sent a first cargo plane with antiviral medication and ventilators, and there will be more to come. Again, let me reassure everyone that what we’re sending is surplus supplies, so it won’t compromise our response here in Canada. To end this pandemic – whether here or elsewhere – we need to fight the virus and its variants all over the world.  That’s why all countries need access to vaccines and treatments. And we need to work together so that no one is left behind. To help low- and middle-income countries access tests, treatments, and vaccines, we will make an additional contribution of $375 million to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator. Internationally, Canada has always been a strong advocate for equitable access to supplies and vaccines. We’ve mobilized over $2.5 billion in response to COVID-19, making our government one of the top contributors to the global efforts. Together, we can continue to deliver lifesaving vaccines, tests, and treatments to the world’s more vulnerable. We also recognize the important role industry has played in developing lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. We’ve been working with partners at the WTO to find a consensus-based solution and are ready to discuss proposals, in particular for COVID-19 vaccines. We remain committed to finding solutions and reaching an agreement that accelerates global vaccine production and does not negatively impact public health. This morning, I’d also like to say a few words about Bill C-3 that received Royal Assent yesterday. This legislation will help restore trust in our criminal justice system for survivors of sexual assault, and for all Canadians, while making sure that everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Of course, this wouldn’t be possible without the efforts of Rona Ambrose, whose Bill C-337 was the foundation for this legislation.   I want to thank Rona for her leadership on this issue and her support in getting this bill through. In closing, I want to remind you how important it is to keep being very careful. While the vaccination effort continues, we have to follow local public health guidelines. Mother’s Day is going to be different again this year, but it’s still the time to think of our moms and thank them. One thing’s for sure, our government will always be there to support mothers and families – during this crisis and beyond. I know that for many people it’s been too long since they’ve been able to hug their moms. But now is not the time to give up. We need to avoid gatherings and keep working together to get through this third wave so we can enjoy the better times ahead."
"33","https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2021/06/18/prime-ministers-remarks-covid-19-situation","Prime Minister’s remarks on the COVID-19 situation",2021-06-18,"Good morning, everyone. Now please don’t be too worried – I’m back in isolation at home, but that doesn’t mean you have to be. In the last week, I had very productive meetings at the G7, NATO, and the Canada-European Union summits. At these summits in Europe with our allies, we made important progress on everything from ending this pandemic for good, to creating middle class jobs. Anyone returning from international travel right now still has to quarantine for 14 days, and that includes me. So today, I’ve got some important news to share, which I’ll do from quarantine here at Rideau Cottage. But before I get started, I want to address the hateful acts that far too many communities in our country have continued to face this week.  It is unacceptable to see a swastika painted in Downsview Park in Toronto. It is unacceptable to have hateful graffiti painted on a mosque in Edmonton. Antisemitism and Islamophobia have no place in our communities, and hatred and discrimination of any kind have no place in our country. This is something we’ll never stand for. Because the cost of turning a blind eye – it’s much too high. Together, we must always denounce these unacceptable acts and support communities, and that is exactly what our government will continue to do. It’s been a difficult few weeks for many people across the country. People in London continue to grieve the loss of the Afzaal family.  In Indigenous communities, this has been a time of mourning. As a country, we have to continue to work for justice, and to build a better Canada for everyone. This morning, I want to share some important updates about vaccine deliveries, supporting communities, and our plan to safely reopen. Let’s start with news on vaccines. Canada is getting millions more Moderna doses brought forward from our summer shipment schedule into June, and we're locking in shipments for the first half of July. We’ve worked hard with Moderna to make this happen, and we’re also getting extra doses from the U.S. Minister Anand will have the breakdown of the numbers later this morning, but here’s the bottom line. Just like we surpassed our delivery numbers for the first quarter of this year, we’re doing the same for the spring quarter. That will mean that for the end of June, as promised, we’ll be at well over 50 million doses total. And by the end of July, we’ll be over 68 million doses for Canadians. I want to thank Minister Anand, her department, and our teams in Washington, D.C. and around the world, who are working to get Canadians as many doses as quickly as possible. A big shout-out as well to Minister Hajdu, and everyone at the Public Health Agency and the National Operations Centre, for coordinating the rollout across the country.   We’ll have more details to share next week about shipment dates for the new Moderna doses. And of course, we’ll provide that information to the provinces and territories right away so that they can get these doses into arms as quickly as possible. Because that’s what this is about, getting you your vaccine as soon as possible. Getting it to your parents, friends, and neighbours. Every dose keeps someone safe. Every dose is a step closer to the end of this pandemic for Canadians. With this many vaccines coming in – and the fact that there are lots of Canadians who are very eager to get their shots – we are on the path to end this crisis in Canada. Almost 75 per cent of eligible Canadians have received a first dose. Together, we will beat COVID-19.  But it’s important to continue to get our first and second doses as soon as possible. That is what will let us see people we have missed during lockdown, and start to get back to more and more of the things we love. Together, we will get through this crisis. No one, and no community, will be left behind. On that note, I want to give an update on support for Kashechewan First Nation in Ontario. In the last few weeks, COVID-19 cases have risen very quickly in the community, mostly among children.  At the end of May, we approved a deployment of the Canadian Rangers to help get the situation under control. Alongside the community, they’ve worked very hard to keep people safe, but even so, cases remain far too high. That’s why we’re approving additional support from the Canadian Armed Forces for Kashechewan First Nation. The Armed Forces will be in the community until at least the end of the month, to help with everything from isolation sites to delivering food. We will continue to be here for all communities, during this crisis and as we rebuild. Yesterday evening, that’s exactly what I discussed with the premiers. As I said to them, I’m focused on supporting Canadians through this crisis, keeping vaccines rolling out, and working together on a responsible reopening. On that final point – reopening – next week our government will have more to say about our plan that will let people get back to travelling while keeping everyone else safe. Finally, this morning I want to address some recent developments in the House of Commons. The work we do in Parliament matters. And it matters because it affects you, your family, and your communities. In the House right now, we’re working to extend support that millions of Canadians need to get through the final stretch of this pandemic, from the wage subsidy to small business loans to the sickness benefit. This is progressive legislation and a progressive agenda that will help Canadians. There’s important work to be done, and not only on supporting people through this crisis. We’re also working to ban the unacceptable, discredited, and harmful practice of conversion therapy. And we’re working to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In other words, we’re working on what matters to you. I’ve been fortunate to know Harjit for a long time. He’s one of the most honest and hardworking people I’ve ever met. His entire career, and now as Minister, he’s been dedicated to transforming the culture of our military. He’s working to combat sexual misconduct in the Armed Forces, including on expanding the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre and he will keep doing that work. We know there’s still much more to be done to protect all those who choose to serve their country. We will keep supporting everyone who serves in the Armed Forces. We will keep supporting you and your family. And we will work every day to build a stronger future for everyone."

Thank you, Ahmed, for that introduction, and for everything you do for families and for all Canadians. It’s also great to be here with Minister Alghabra, and with our whole Brampton team – Kamal, Sonia, Maninder, and Ruby – for this important announcement today. I want to start today by thanking people across the country for everything you’re doing to help beat COVID in Canada. When you roll up your sleeve to get vaccinated, you keep yourself and others safe, and you keep us all on the right path to end the pandemic once and for all. Your efforts are paying off. This weekend, we even passed the U.S. in terms of fully vaccinated people. So let’s keep that momentum up. The science is clear. These vaccines are safe and effective. For those of you who think that a first or second vaccine shot isn’t necessary: I ask that you reconsider. Vaccines prevent you from getting sick, from going to the hospital, and from getting your loved ones sick. Now is the time to do it. So if you haven’t already done so, make sure you book an appointment and get the shot. We’re expecting 7.1 million Pfizer and Moderna doses to arrive in Canada this week. The shots are there for you and that’s good news all around. Thanks to the rising vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 cases, we’re able to move forward with adjusted border measures. As long as things stay on the right track, we’ll open our borders on September 7 to any traveller who’s fully vaccinated with a Canada-approved vaccine at least 14 days before arriving. As a first step, on August 9, we will opening non-essential travel to Americans who’ve been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days. This is in recognition of our unique bond, especially between border communities. We are continuing to take a measured approach to re-opening the borders. The health and safety of Canadians remains our top priority, and we will never compromise on that. Now, on to today’s announcement. The people of Brampton have shown true resilience over the last year and a half. I know it hasn’t been easy. You’ve all had to adapt in many different ways. So many of you have made big sacrifices and faced loss. But what didn’t change throughout all this, is the tremendous community spirit here in Brampton and your devotion and commitment to being there for each other.   Your very own Member of Parliament, Kamal Khera, proved that when she returned to work as a nurse at the height of the pandemic.   Thank you, Kamal. You’ve inspired your community. You’ve touched the lives of so many with your dedication and your hard work. Today, we’re here because too many Canadians are still facing very real obstacles when it comes to housing affordability and availability. Since 2015, in Brampton alone, we’ve funded more than 1,600 housing units to tackle the issue. Across the country, we’ve implemented programs like the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, which provides support to make mortgages more affordable for younger Canadians. In addition, our Rental Construction Financing Initiative has leveraged billions of dollars in private investments to build tens of thousands of new affordable rental units in communities large and small. These are significant accomplishments. Nonetheless, we’re looking to the future knowing we need to do more. That’s why Minister Hussen and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland have brought together leaders from all orders of government and across sectors to tackle this pressing issue. We’re working hard to develop solutions that will increase the supply of housing for Canadians, from affordable rental units to ownership options. The pandemic has only worsened housing gaps and inequalities, and we know that Canada needs more housing options, and fast. Today, I’m joined by our Brampton team to announce the construction of 302 new rental units, here at Mount Pleasant Village. We’re building a 26 story residential tower, so that hard-working, middle class Canadians will be able to live close to where they work. Take a young grocery store worker who wants to stay in this community but simply can’t afford to buy a home and needs more rental options close to their workplace. This is who these affordable units are for.    Today’s announcement is about increasing the rental supply in Canada, something that has been overlooked for far too many decades. It’s part of a program that continues to help families across the country who are feeling priced out of the housing market.   As we work to build back better after this pandemic, affordable housing remains at the top of our priority list.  More and more young professionals, families, and multi-generation households are setting roots here in Brampton. The city is growing at a record speed. We know that buying a home has become beyond the reach of far too many families. That’s why we’re delivering innovative solutions. We’re also finding new ways to create good-paying jobs while we’re at it. Take our latest budget investment of $300 million to convert vacant commercial property into hundreds of rental housing units. This is an opportunity for property owners and communities to explore converting excess space into rental housing, thereby making urban communities, like Brampton, more livable and more affordable. We’re also exploring ways to unlock public land as a tool to create affordable units and innovative pathways to homeownership, including rent to own models. This kind of leadership and innovative approach to housing is what this country needs.  Once people have secure, stable, and affordable housing, they’re able to start fulfilling their potential. That’s why we shouldn’t think of housing as just a problem, but also as a solution. We have made great strides in the last few years, but we know there’s still more work to be done. And that’s exactly why we’re here today. Housing will always be part of the solution for healthier communities, but also for attracting and retaining workers and growing our economy. As a government, we’re in your corner. We’ll continue to support our recovery, create middle class jobs, and boost economic growth. And together, we’ll keep building a better Canada and a better future for everyone Thank you very much."
